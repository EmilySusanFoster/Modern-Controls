      <h3>System Model</h3>

      <p>The exit thickness <i>h</i> is obviously related to the gap between the
      rolls, which is, in turn, related to the unloaded position of the backup
      rolls <i>s</i> (also called the unloaded screw position) and the input
      thickness <i>H</i>. More specifically, the force on the rolls is given by</p>

      <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>M</i> ( <i>h</i> - <i>s</i> )

      <p>Another equation for force is

      <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>W</i> ( <i>H</i> - <i>h</i> )

      <p>Combining these two gives

      <p align="center"><i>h</i> ( <i>M</i> + <i>W</i> ) = <i>M s</i> + <i>W H</i>

      <p align="center"><img src="img30.gif" border="0" width="157" height="35">

      <p>Usually, we find that

      <p align="center"><img src="img32.gif" border="0" align="middle" width="76" height="35"> and <img src="img33.gif" border="0" align="middle" width="76" height="35">

      <p>The problem is that the exit thickness <i>h</i> cannot be measured
      immediately after it leaves the roll gap, but is measured further down the
      line, introducing a measurement delay into the system. This delay
      obviously depends on the speed of the steel exiting the mill, but we will
      assume that it is constant at one second. (We know intuitively that a
      measurement delay is undesirable, since the control system is working with
      information which is not current.)

      <p>This leads us to the following model for the closed loop system:

      <p>The controller is

      <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

      <p>The JAVA applet below is a simulation of the above system. The control
      parameters have been chosen as <i>k<sub>p</sub></i> = 0.25 and <i>k<sub>i</sub></i>
      = 2.5 to provide a reasonable response. The graph has a vertical scale of
      0.1mm per division and a horizontal scale of 2 seconds per division. It
      shows the set-point (the blue trace), the actual exit thickness <i>h</i>
      (the green trace) and the measured (delayed) exit thickness <i>h<sub>m</sub></i>
      (the red trace).</p>

      <p>There is also a 10 ms time constant associated with changing the screw
      position <i>s</i> which is not shown in the above diagram, but is included
      in the simulation.

      <p>Pressing the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button allows you to change
      the set point, the input thickness <i>H</i>, the controller parameters <i>k<sub>p</sub></i>
      and <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> and the amount of measurement noise in the
      system. It is not possible to have a set point larger than the input
      thickness, neither of which may be negative. When you change the input
      thickness, the animation shows the &quot;disturbance&quot; approaching,
      and it only takes effect when it reaches the rolls. Try experimenting with
      these parameters.

          <td align="center"><b>Things to try</b></td>
          <td align="center"><b>Things to notice</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change the input thickness to 0.5</td>
          <td>Watch the disturbance response and the effect of the time delay</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change the set point to 0.3</td>
          <td>Watch the set-point response and the effect of the time delay</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Increase the controller gain to try and increase the system's
            response speed</td>
          <td>The system goes unstable even for relatively low loop gains.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>You will notice that it is not possible to produce a good stable
      response due to the presence of the time delay. If you are wondering about
      the sinusoidal component in the output, then have patience - we'll come to
      that shortly.

      <p>Next, we try some more advanced control ideas on this system to try and
      work around this time delay.</p>
