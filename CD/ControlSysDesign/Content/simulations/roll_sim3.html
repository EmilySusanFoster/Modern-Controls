      <h3>Soft Sensors</h3>

      <p>The most common method of avoiding the time delay in the measurement of
      exit thickness <i>h</i> is to infer the exit thickness from the force on
      the rolls (which can be easily measured). Such a devices are known as
      BISRA gauges, and were first invented in 1954. Since

      <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>M</i> ( <i>h</i> - <i>s</i> )

      <p>we can measure force and then estimate exit thickness as

      <p>The following diagram shows the resulting system.

      <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

      <p>The JAVA applet below is a simulation of the above system. As before,
      the control parameters have been chosen as <i>k<sub>p</sub></i> = 10 and <i>k<sub>i</sub></i>
      = 100. The graph again has a vertical scale of 0.1mm per division. It
      shows the set-point (the blue trace) and the actual exit thickness <i>h</i>
      (the green trace).</p>

      <p>By eliminating the delay in the system, we allow much faster responses
      (with time constants as low as 10ms). Since such fast responses would not
      be easily visible in real-time, the simulation below allows the user to
      slow down the passage of time in the simulation. In the &quot;Simulation
      Parameters&quot; window, the time per horizontal division of the graph can
      be varied, like an oscilloscope. This time/division also affects the
      animation presented beside the graph. (This simulation is of course a
      discrete time approximation of the continuous time system. The time step
      for the simulation is 0.001 seconds due to the speed of the system, so if
      you change the time scale to 2 sec/div, the simulation has to try and do
      1000 time steps each second, which may result in the simulation slowing
      down on slower computers. If the time scale is 0.2 sec/div, then only 100
      time steps must be done per second, allowing the simulation to run much
      faster.)</p>

      <p>Otherwise, the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button allows you to
      change the same parameters as in the last simulation.

          <td>The delay now has now effect on the disturbance response</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Increase the controller gain to try and increase the system's
            response speed</td>
          <td>The gain must be much higher for the system to go unstable,
            meaning that this system can have a larger closed-loop bandwidth</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change the time scale on the graph to 2 sec/div and compare the
            magnitude of the sinusoidal variations to the previous example</td>

            using the BISRA gauge</td>
        </tr>

      <p>You have most likely observed that now the system's response speed is
      now very fast. However, the sinusoidal variations in the output have
      increased in size to the point where they can no longer be ignored.
      (Previously, the time delay was our main concern.)

      <p>Next, we look at the source of these variations and a possible
      solution.</p>
