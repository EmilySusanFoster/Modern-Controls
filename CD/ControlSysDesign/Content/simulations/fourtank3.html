        <h3>Apparatus</h3>

        <p>The apparatus used to control the system shown on the previous page
        follows. The system is controlled via a PC which outputs a reference
        voltage to a Pulse Width Modulator. The Pulse Width Modulator produces a
        modulated signal to a power amplifier which powers the pumps. This setup
        provides a very high level of linearity to the system. This was the
        assumption made by the equations used to represent the system.

        <p>The levels in the tanks are sensed using Low Pressure Differential
        Sensors and feed back to the PC via amplifiers which are used to bring
        the voltage output of the sensors to range between 0-5volts.&nbsp; This
        signal is feed through LC Low Pass Filters to cut out any noise
        associated with the signal providing a voltage reference which is easily
        distinguishable.</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="foutank2.gif" width="540" height="231"></p>

        <p>The dynamics of each part of the system is represented on the above
        diagram and is a useful illustrative example of the design
        considerations which were encountered.</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fourtank4.jpg" width="576" height="432"></p>

        <p>The diagram above shows the Four Tank Laboratory Apparatus.&nbsp; The
        program used to control the apparatus was the UNAC program.&nbsp; The
        UNAC program uses building block which are very similar to the block
        used in MATLAB. This makes the program easy to use for anyone who has
        not had any experience with the program.&nbsp; A Decentralized PI
        controller was used in this project to investigate multivariable
        phenomenon.</p>

        <p><img border="0" src="foutank3.gif" width="592" height="346"></p>

        <p>Above is a diagram of the Decentralized PI controller used to test
        the characteristics of the system and also to compare the results found
        using the physical apparatus. This enabled comparisons to be made and
        hence conclusion on how well the apparatus was modeled.

        <p>This system has a multivariable zero associated with it which can be
        placed in the left or right half plane. Note that this diagram shows the
        apparatus operating in minimum phase which corresponds to more water
        going to the bottom two tank than to the top two tanks.

        <p>To operate the tanks in non-minimum phase more water would be
        directed to the top two tanks.&nbsp; It was found that control of the
        apparatus is far more difficult under these conditions to those of the
        minimum phase.&nbsp; The further the right hand pole is place in the
        right hand plane the more difficult the apparatus is to control.</p>
