      <p>Normally, the reagent concentration is constant, and we control the
      effluent pH by varying the reagent flow. Note that the concentrations are <i>excess
      </i>concentrations, meaning that they measure the concentration of
      hydrogen ions in excess to that found in water. We can convert an excess
      concentration <i>C</i> to pH using the following formula.</p>
      <div align="center">

      <p align="left">From this formula, we can see that an excess concentration
      of 0 gives a pH of 7 (which is the pH of water, as expected). Also,
      negative excess concentrations correspond to acidic pH, and positive
      excess concentrations correspond to basic pH.</p>

      <p align="left"><b>NOTE</b>: The reader should already be aware that if a
      weak acid or weak base is used, the titration curve will be substantially
      different. The differential equation (1) represents the dynamic equation
      for a strong acid-strong base titration curve. For any other acid-base
      combination (e.g. weak acid-strong base), the system model will be
      substantially different, as will equation (2) for finding concentration
      from pH. The graph below shows the titration curve for a strong
      acid-strong base system.</p>

      <h3 align="left">Control Design</h3>

      <p align="left">We assume that the tank system has a level controller
      which maintains a constant liquid volume in the tank. The reagent flow is
      controlled using a simple PI controller as shown in the figure below. Note
      that the control valve on the reagent pipe has a saturation, since it can
      be fully open (giving a maximum flow rate) or fully closed (giving a
      minimum flow rate of zero).</p>

      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="ph2.gif" width="429" height="160"></p>

      <p align="left">For the purposes of designing the controller, the plant is
      linearised by assuming that the reagent flow is much smaller than the
      influent flow (since the reagent is more concentrated). This results in
      the linear model shown below.</p>

      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="ph3.gif" width="291" height="173"></p>

      <p align="left">The controller is designed so that the closed-loop
      bandwidth is twice that of the open-loop bandwidth. This way, the initial
      peak in reagent flow falls within the limits imposed by the valve. It may
      seem logical to construct a larger valve so that a faster controller can
      be implemented, but we will see later that this carries with it serious
      design tradeoffs which mitigate against going too far in this direction.</p>

      <p align="left">For this example, we choose the parameter values as</p>

      <p>and design a PI controller with <i>k<sub>p</sub></i> = 3<i>q </i>/ <i>c<sub>u</sub></i>
      and <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> = 4<i>q</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>Vc<sub>u</sub></i>.
      Note that the primary concern of the controller is to reject disturbances
      rather than to follow a set-point, since the set-point will always be a pH
      of 7. Also, we assume that the control valve allows a maximum reagent flow
      rate of 1.5 <i>L</i> / <i>min</i>.</p>

      <p>There is an inherent problem with the pH control system: the measured
      output is pH, but what we want to control is hydrogen ion concentration
      (using pH as the control variable with a set point of 7 would make the
      system even more non-linear than it already is). If we did not know
      equation (2) for converting between ion concentration and pH, we would
      have to attempt to estimate the titration curve, possibly linearising it
      to find ion concentration. The pH curve looks almost vertical in the
      middle, but upon magnification we find that it is not linear at all. Thus,
      linearising the titration curve has serious sensitivity ramifications for
      the control system.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, in this case we know the function for pH in terms of
      concentration, so we can simply invert this equation to find the ion
      concentration for the measured pH. This is rarely possible in practise.</p>

      <p>Note that when measuring the effluent pH, there is a delay of the order
      of 5 seconds. It is safe to ignore this delay considering the time scales
      we are looking at (i.e. with a plant time constant of 500 seconds).</p>
      <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

      <p>Below is a Java applet which simulates the above pH neutralisation
      system. The blue plot shows the influent concentration and the green plot
      shows the effluent concentration. This process is extremely slow, so the
      time scale is accelerated somewhat: 1250 simulated seconds pass for each
      real second of the simulation, giving a horizontal scale of 2500 seconds
      per division

      <p>Pressing the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button brings up the
      parameters window allowing you to change the controller values, the
      influent pH and the animation speed. The controller has been implemented
      in the anti-windup form to avoid the effects of the saturation of the
      valve. The animation speed can be 25, 12.5 or 6.25 frames per second. This
      speed is only the rate at which the screen is refreshed - the simulation
      is unaffected. The speed function is available for those with slower
      computers so that the simulations still appear in real-time (if somewhat
      jerkier). Note that the applet does some auto-detection of the speed of
      your computer, so if you select a speed that your computer cannot handle,
      the applet will reduce the speed accordingly.</p>

      </table>

      <p>The observed non-linear output response is due in part to the
      non-linear system. However, most of the non-linearity arises from the fact
      that we are measuring pH which is a logarithmic function of the excess ion
      concentration. It is hydrogen ion concentration that we are concerned with
      controlling, but we measure pH since environmental laws specify the
      acceptable effluent pH ranges (the tolerance could be as small as 0.5 of a
      pH).</p>

      <p>In this simulation, it was assumed that both the influent flow and
      concentration were constant, but this is rarely the case. The next page
      looks at the effect of varying the influent flow rate.</p>
