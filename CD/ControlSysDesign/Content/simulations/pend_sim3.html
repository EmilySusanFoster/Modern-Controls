        <h3>Cascaded Control</h3>

        <p>If we measure the angle of the pendulum as well as the cart position,
        controlling the inverted pendulum system is much easier. To see this
        intuitively, try balancing a broom on the palm of your hand with your
        eyes shut (i.e. you know cart position only) and with your eyes open
        (i.e. you know both position and angle). Generally, the angle is
        measured using a potentiometer (a type of variable resistor). A block
        diagram of the system is:

        <p align="center"><img src="cascade.gif" border="0" align="center" width="409" height="100">

        <p>So we can form two control loops for the system, with the inner loop
        controlling the pendulum angle, and the outer loop controlling the cart
        position.

        <p align="center"><img src="cascade2.gif" border="0" align="center" width="427" height="117">

        <p>First, we design the controller for the inner loop. Let us use the
        root-locus design method. Since the inner plant has poles at +4.4621 and
        -4.4721, the root locus will look like:

        <p align="center"><img src="cascade3.gif" border="0" align="center" width="483" height="374">

        <p>If we use PD control, we have the controller <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>k<sub>d</sub>
        s</i> + <i>k<sub>p</sub></i>, which allows us to place a zero on the
        real axis. If we place this zero on top of the stable pole, the root
        locus will have a single branch extending left from the unstable pole,
        so with a high enough gain, we can make the system stable. However, we
        never use a pure derivative in control (since it amplifies noise too
        much - look at its frequency response), instead we use a differentiator
        in series with a low pass filter. This low pass filter is chosen to have
        a bandwidth much larger than the system bandwidth. Thus, the
        implementation of the PD controller will be (with appropriate zero and
        gain choice):

        <p align="center"><img src="img23.gif" border="0" align="center" width="125" height="40">

        <p>and the resulting root locus (with controller poles and zeros in
        purple) is:

        <p align="center"><img src="cascade4.gif" border="0" align="center" width="486" height="380">

        <p>Note the effect of not cancelling the stable pole exactly. The effect
        of the added pole at -25 due to the low pass filter is to cause the
        root-locus branched to break away from the negative real axis. This
        could cause poorly damped oscillations if the gain of the controller is
        too high.

        <p>For the design of the outer loop controller, we will use frequency
        response methods. A PD controller will be used, but such a controller is
        generally called a <b>lead compensator</b> when using this method.
        First, we look at the frequency response of the &quot;plant&quot; (which
        in this case is the closed inner loop system in series with the cart
        mechanics):

        <p align="center"><img src="cascade5.gif" border="0" align="center" width="522" height="407">

        <p>Note that this frequency response has a negative phase margin (which
        is given by 180° + <i>p</i>, where <i>p</i> is the phase shift at the
        frequency at which the gain is 1). For stability, a phase margin of more
        than 0° is needed, but for robust stability, a phase margin of 50° or
        more is suggested. The compensator is thus chosen as

        <p align="center"><img src="img24.gif" border="0" align="center" width="145" height="40">

        <p>The frequency response of this compensator is shown below.

        <p align="center"><img src="cascade6.gif" border="0" align="center" width="508" height="398">

        <p>The lead compensator has three parameters which can be adjusted: the
        pole position, the zero position and the loop gain. Generally the pole
        and zero position differ by a factor of 10, which provides the desirable
        positive &quot;bump&quot; in the phase response. The positions of the
        pole and zero are chosen such that the compensator lead (or
        &quot;bump&quot;) in the frequency response is at the optimal position
        relative to the plant's response (i.e. we are trying to boost the
        plant's phase response above 180°). The gain of the compensator is
        chosen to make the magnitude of the open loop system 0 dB at the peak of
        the phase response (to guarantee the phase margin).

        <p>The frequency response of the entire open loop system is:

        <p align="center"><img src="cascade7.gif" border="0" align="center" width="513" height="400">

        <p>Note that the gain margin is now about 55°, which is acceptable. The
        gain margin (in case you're interested) is 8 dB (which is also
        acceptable for robust stability).
