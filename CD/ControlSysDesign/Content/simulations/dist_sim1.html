        <h3>Design of Columns</h3>

        <p>The design of multistage columns for binary mixtures can be
        accomplished graphically, via equilibrium curves. This is called the
        McCabe-Thiele Method. Equilibrium curves plot the volatility of
        components in a mixture; that is, the proportion of species 1 in the
        vapour phase (y<sub>1</sub>) compared with the proportion of species 1
        in the liquid phase (x<sub>1</sub>). The figure below shows two common
        curves: curve A is a species with normal volatility, and curve B is a
        system with a homogeneous azeotrope. The curves allow us to determine y<sub>1</sub>
        from x<sub>1</sub> given constant temperature and pressure.</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="DCeq.gif" width="511" height="401"></p>

        <p>The azeotrope indicates that a component that is more volatile at low
        x<sub>1</sub> becomes less volatile at high x<sub>1</sub> (above the
        azeotrope). This limits the separation that can be achieved between
        components.<br>
        As an example, for an ethanol-water mixture, there is an azeotrope at x<sub>1</sub>
        = 0.8943 (for pressure of 101.3 kPa and temperature of 78.15 °C) thus
        the maximum distillate composition that can be achieved is x<sub>d</sub>
        = 0.8943. The distillate cannot have higher purity than this value from
        binary<br>
        separation.</p>

        <p>The McCabe-Thiele Method allows the designer to determine the number
        of trays needed to distil a mixture to the required purity. As well as
        the equilibrium curve, other factors such as the feed quality (i.e. the
        thermal condition of the feed, which could be subcooled, saturated,
        superheated etc), the ratio of liquid to vapour flow and the proportion
        of species 1 in the feed are used in distillation column design.</p>

        <p>Based on these calculations, and the required spacing between plates,
        the theoretical height of the column can be determined. For example, for
        a certain configuration the required number of trays for an
        ethanol-water mixture may be 60. At a spacing of 25 cm, this will give a
        height of 15 m. This may be excessive, and so the usual practice is to
        set the number of trays and then set the reflux ratio <i>L</i>/<i>D</i>.
        e.g. for our example the number of trays are set to 12, and the reflux
        ratio is then set to 5 (5×12&nbsp;=&nbsp;60). Thus only 1/5th of the
        product is being drawn out at any time, which means that product is
        recirculating through the column about five times.</p>

        <p>Thus it is important to have a fixed reflux ratio in steady state.
        The optimum feed tray can also be determined using this method.</p>
        <h3>Control Configuration</h3>

        <p>As the diagram shows, there are four valves which are used to control
        the flow rate of <i>B</i> (the bottom product), the temperature of <i>V</i>
        (the boilup), the flow rate of <i>L</i> (the reflux) and the flow rate
        of <i>D</i> (the distillate).</p>

        <p>The system as shown above has four inputs and four outputs:</p>
        <div align="center">

          <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" align="center"><b>Input Variables</b></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" align="center">Bottom product flow rate <i>B</i></td>
              <td width="50%" align="center">Reboiler level</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" align="center">Reflux flow rate <i>L</i></td>
              <td width="50%" align="center">Distillate composition</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" align="center">Steam flow<br>
                (which affects the temperature of <i>V</i>)</td>
              <td width="50%" align="center">Bottom product composition</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          </center>
        </div>

        <p>The overhead vapour <i>V</i><sub>T</sub> is also generally considered
        an input variable and is mainly used to control the column pressure.
        Since this is usually a self-regulating loop, we will ignore it in this
        discussion.</p>

        <p>Obviously, it is desirable to maximise the purity of the top and
        bottom products. Normally in industry, the control variables are set
        manually by human operators. Some plants use automatic control for only
        one product, and manual control for the other. Manual control can result
        in overpurification or loss of valuable product. These difficulties can
        be overcome by using <i>dual composition control</i>, i.e. automatic
        control for both products.</p>

        <p>There are some difficulties involved in designing a dual composition
        controller. In particular, the system is both strongly nonlinear and
        strongly interactive. Also, the system has a very sluggish response, and
        there are many problems with measuring the output variables (including
        dead times for composition measurements).</p>

        <p>Choosing the control structure is the most important step in
        designing a controller for the system. The column pressure and reboiler
        and condenser levels must be controlled very carefully to maintain
        stable operation. The control systems for these variables are called <i>inventory
        controllers</i>. This leaves two degrees of freedom to control the top
        and bottom concentrations. Deciding the control structure then amounts
        to choosing which two inputs will control the compositions.</p>

        <p>The most common is called the <i>LV</i> configuration, where the
        reflux flow rate <i>L</i> is used to control the composition of the top
        product, and the boilup temperature <i>V</i> is used to control the
        composition of the bottom product. In this case, the distillate flow
        rate <i>D</i> and&nbsp; bottom product flow rate <i>B</i> are used to
        control the levels of the condenser and reboiler respectively. The
        variables <i>L</i> and <i>V</i> are the ones most likely to be used by a
        manual operator to control the product compositions.</p>

        <p>Another common choice is the <i>DV</i> configuration, where the
        distillate flow rate <i>D</i> is used to control the composition of the
        top product, and the boilup temperature <i>V</i> is used to control the
        composition of the bottom product. For this configuration, the reflux
        flow rate <i>L</i> and&nbsp; bottom product flow rate <i>B</i> are used
        to control the levels of the condenser and reboiler respectively.</p>
        <h3>System Model and Control Design</h3>

        <p>As a real example we will describe a case study based on a pilot
        scale distillation column in Chemical Engineering at Sydney University
        (click <a href="distillation.html">here</a> for photos). This column has
        been used for joint cooperative work between Electrical and Computer
        Engineering in Newcastle and Chemical Engineering at Sydney for the past
        3 years. Assistance from Professor Romagnoli of Chem Eng Sydney is
        particularly acknowledged in supporting this collaboration. The joint
        work focused on several issues including - multimodel control,
        autotuning of controllers and soft sensors for composition. Much of the
        detailed work was done by Julio Rodreguez who also provided assistance
        in constructing this page. For purposes of illustration , we take a
        simple linear control problem motivated by work on this pilot column.</p>

        <p>The pilot column in question has twelve plates and separates ethanol
        and water. The goal in controlling the column is to control the
        concentration of the top and bottom product However, while we can
        measure the top product concentration, it is difficult to measure bottom
        product concentration. Instead, we measure the temperature of the bottom
        plate and use a conversion to give us the bottom concentration. An
        approximate model of the system for the LV control configuration is</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="dist_eq3.gif" border="0" width="354" height="124"></p>

        <p>Where <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>s</i>) is the mole fraction of ethanol
        in the overhead vapour, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>s</i>) is the
        temperature (in degrees celcius) of the bottom plate, <i>u</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>s</i>)
        is the reflux flowrate (in L/min), and <i>u</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>s</i>) is
        the reboiler steam pressure (in kg/min).</p>

        <p>Note that these time constants are presented in <i>minutes</i> rather
        than seconds, since this process is very slow (like most chemical
        processes). Note also that the composition of the feed is fixed at some
        point. (Normally the feed composition is a disturbance in the system.)
        To convert between bottom temperature and bottom concentration, we use
        the following graph.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="dist_graph1.gif" border="0" width="526" height="403"></p>

        <p>Note also that this model is a linearisation, and is only valid in a
        specific operating range. Obviously the temperature can never exceed
        100°C (since then there would be no liquid, only vapour). This model is
        specifically for the <i>LV</i> configuration, and the model assumes that
        the inventory controllers work well.</p>

        <p>The next step is to design an appropriate controller for the system.
        Firstly, we will consider controlling the column with two decentralised
        PID controllers. The obvious choice is that we control the top
        concentration with reflux <i>L</i> and the bottom concentration with
        boilup <i>V</i>. The controller for the plant then is</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="dist_eq2.gif" width="287" height="99"></p>

        <p align="left">Since this controller is decentralised, if we change the
        set-point for one concentration (or a disturbance appears), then the
        value of the other concentration will be affected.</p>
        <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

        <p>Below is a Java applet which simulates the above distillation column.
        The controllers in this example are two decentralised PI controllers,
        with <i>k<sub>p</sub></i> = 1 and <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> = 0.25 for the
        top concentration control and <i>k<sub>p</sub></i> = 1 and <i>k<sub>i</sub></i>
        = 0.15 for the bottom temperature control.</p>

        <p>The red plot shows the bottom temperature on a scale from 0°C to
        100°C and the blue plot shows the top concentration % on a scale from 0
        to 100. The colour of the plates indicates their temperature, with blue
        being coolest and red being hottest (Note that the coolest temperature
        is 85°C which is still quite hot! Currently, all plates are shown as
        being the same temperature as the bottom plate. The time scale is
        accelerated, with 5 minutes of simulated time occurring every second.

            <tr>
              <td align="left">Change the top concentration set-point to 0.75</td>
              <td align="left">Observe the response of both outputs, noting that
                they both change (even though the bottom temperature setpoint
                remained constant)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td align="left">Change the bottom temperature set-point to 85</td>
              <td align="left">Observe the response of both outputs, noting
                again that they both change</td>
            </tr>

        </div>

        <p>As you can see, a decentralised PID controller is not effective at
        decoupling the outputs. To achieve decoupling, we must turn to more
        advanced ideas in MIMO control, as covered in chapter ??? of the book.</p>
