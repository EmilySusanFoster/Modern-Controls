<h3>
System Description</h3>
The problem is that of continuous casting (described more fully in <a href="../chapters/sec2_3.html">Section
2.3</a>), where molten steel flows into a mold (at a rate controlled by
a valve) which is open from above and below. Through cooling, the steel
in the mold is transformed into a semi-solid state and the steel comes
out in continuous slab. This is illustrated in <a href="../chapters/sec2_3.html#fig:fig2_2">Figure
2.2</a>. This <a href="casting.html">photo</a> shows the continuous caster
at BHP in Newcastle, Australia.&nbsp;
<p>It is desirable to be able to control the level of the molten steel
in the mold to prevent it from overflowing or emptying. We can control
this level by adjusting the control valve, based on measurements of the
casting speed and the valve position. <a href="../chapters/sec2_3_2.html#fig:fig2_4">Figure
2.4</a> and <a href="../chapters/sec2_3_3.html#fig:fig2_5">Figure 2.5</a>
illustrate the model of the system and the controller implemented. For
more details, see <a href="../chapters/sec2_3.html">Section 2.3</a>.&nbsp;
<h3>
Java Applet Simulation</h3>
The JAVA applet below is a simulation of this model which allows you to
alter the various system parameters and see the results. Edit the value
for the controller gain <i>K</i> and the level of noise (set this to zero
to remove noise completely). The set-point type can also be altered between
square and sinusoidal. Note: you must press the "Update" button to see
the results of your changes. The simulation can be stopped and restarted
by pressing the start and stop buttons.&nbsp;

<tr>
<td>Change the controller gain to <i>K</i> = 1</td>

<td>The response is very slow.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Change the controller gain to <i>K</i> = 5</td>

<td>The response is faster, but jumps around a lot due to the influence
of measurement noise</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Experiment with the controller gain to try and get a fast response
with little noise influence</td>

<td>There might be a trade-off between speed and noise attenuation</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now there are several things you should notice. For small controller
gains (e.g. <i>K</i> = 1), the system does not respond very quickly, and
is not very susceptible to noise. For larger controller gains (e.g. <i>K</i>
= 5), the system responds more quickly, but is much more susceptible to
noise. (Obviously, susceptibility to noise is not desirable, since in this
case, the controller is working with an incorrect measurement (due to measurement
noise).)&nbsp;
<p>This immediately hints at a trade-off between response speed and noise
sensitivity. At this point, you might ask whether or not this can be solved
with a better controller (so that we can have both good noise rejection
and fast response speed), or whether this is a fundamental constraint.
The rest of the book is dedicated to answering this (and <b>many</b> other
questions).&nbsp;
