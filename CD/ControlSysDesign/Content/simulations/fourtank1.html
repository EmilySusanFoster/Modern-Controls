        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>The Four Tank Laboratory Apparatus is a multivariable laboratory
        process, which consists of four interconnected tanks. The project was
        inspired by a paper published for the 17th Annual Control Conference in
        Philadelphia by the Department of Automation and Control at the Lund
        Institute of Technology. This paper described a multivariable process
        with four interconnected tanks with an adjustable zero, which can be
        moved along the real axis in the left or right hand plane.</p>

        <p>The purpose for replicating this process was to introduce this
        apparatus into the Centre of Integrated Dynamics and Controls (CIDAC)
        short course program at the Newcastle University. It is anticipated that
        the patrons of the short course program will be given hands on
        experience in the<br>
        control of this multivariable (MIMO) process. This apparatus allows
        patrons to practice system modeling, investigate the effects of moving
        the adjustable multivariable zero and hence investigate the limitations
        of MIMO control. The system was seen as a very useful tool to illustrate
        the various phenomena associated with the control of a multivariable
        process.</p>

        <p>The apparatus is made up of four tanks and two pumps. The inputs
        being a voltage output from a PC and the outputs are levels in two of
        the four tanks represented by a voltage and fed back to the PC. Valves
        are used to adjust the multivariable zero. Implementation of this design
        involved the identification of the various systems dynamics. This
        involved analysis of flows, pump characteristics, sensor responses,
        effects of noise, power consumption and voltage requirements.</p>

        <p>Non-linear equations are derived for the physical apparatus using
        various formulas and equations that describe the various components of
        the apparatus and describe the process in terms of tank height. These
        were used firstly in the specification of the various apparatus
        components and secondly used as the equations that are linearized later
        in the report so that a linear representation of the plant in the form
        of a transfer function can be achieved and investigated.</p>

        <p>Simulations were initially used to verify the accuracy of the
        linearized equation modeling by running simulations on a simple SISO
        system with both non-linear and linear representations. Once it was
        verified that the responses did closely match a detailed simulation of
        the whole process was undertaken. This was achieved using Decentralized
        PID control. Tests including the systems response to noise and stability
        were undertaken on the simulation model of the plant.</p>

        <p>Comparison of results between the simulated plant response and the
        real plants response controlled using a PID block in the UNAC program
        are made. The simulation model represented the real apparatus and a
        hence an investigation into how accurately the simulation model
        represented the<br>
        real process was of interest. The accuracy of the linearized equations,
        which represent the system model, is investigated from these results.</p>
