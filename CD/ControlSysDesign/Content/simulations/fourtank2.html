        <h3>Dynamics</h3>

        <p>This apparatus consists of four interconnected water tanks, two pumps
        and associated valves. The apparatus inputs are the supplies to the
        pumps, v1 and v2, (voltages) and the outputs are the water levels in the
        bottom two tanks, y1 and y2 (voltages). The flow to each tank is
        adjusted using the associated valves.</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="foutank1.gif" width="448" height="411"></p>

        <p>The first step was to derive a mathematical model of the Four tank
        laboratory apparatus.<br>
        The derivation comes from physical data, which can be found in nearly
        all chemical engineering<br>
        textbooks and has been applied to the apparatus shown in Figure 1.</p>

        <p>Mass balance for one of the tanks gives:</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fourtank-eq1.gif" width="100" height="37"></p>

        <p>Where A denotes the cross section of the tank, h&gt;=0 the water
        level and qin&gt;=0 and qout&gt;=0 the inflow and outflow of the tank,
        respectively.&nbsp; In order to establish a relationship between output
        and height Bernoulli’s Law is used and states that</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fourtank-eq2.gif" width="87" height="26"></p>

        <p>where a is the cross section of the outlet hole and g is the
        acceleration due to gravity.&nbsp; This relationship is roughly the
        expected output due to height relationship although it does not take
        into account any flow dynamics of the orifice.&nbsp; A common
        multiplying factor for an orifice of the type being used in this
        apparatus is

        <p align="center">Coefficient of discharge k = 0.90 (in this case)

        <p>We can therefor re-write Bernoulli’s Equation</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fourtank-eq3.gif" width="90" height="26"></p>

        <p>The flow through each pump is split so that a proportion of the total
        flow travels to each corresponding tank. This can be adjusted via one of
        the two valves shown in Figure 1.&nbsp; Assuming that the flow generated
        is proportional to the voltage applied to each pump, (change)v, and that
        qT and qB are the flows going to the top and bottom tanks, respectfully
        and by letting the parameter ? be determined by how the valves are set.
        We are able to come up with the following relationship.</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fourtank-eq4.gif" width="487" height="29"></p>

        <p>Combining all the equations for the interconnected Four Tank
        Laboratory Apparatus we are able to<br>
        come up with the following equations, which represent the physical
        system.</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fourtank-eq5.gif" width="248" height="148"></p>

        <p>All numbers associated with the coefficients relate to the pump or
        tank that the particular coefficient is associated with.</p>
