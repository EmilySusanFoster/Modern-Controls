        <h3>System Model</h3>

        <p>The modelling of the ball and plate system comes straight from simple
        Newtonian physics. The equation for acceleration of the ball down the
        plate is given by</p>

        <p align="CENTER"><img src="eq5.gif" alt="equation" width="126" height="35">

        <p>This simplistic model ignores the forces on the ball due to the
        motion of the plate, but we will see later that there are stronger
        influences on the system than this modelling error. The measurement of
        the ball position is made by a camera directly above the plate. The
        camera will thus project the ball's position onto a two-dimensional
        plane, meaning that the observed position of the ball is given by

        <p align="CENTER"><img src="eq6.gif" alt="equation" width="170" height="35">

        <p>Since <img src="img6.gif" border="0" width="12" height="15"> is small (we will only be
        tilting the plate by a small amount), and assuming that <i>g</i> = 9.8,
        the transfer function can be linearised to

        <p align="CENTER"><img src="eq7.gif" alt="equation" width="51" height="40">

        <p>remembering that <img src="img2.gif" border="0" width="68" height="15"> and <img src="img3.gif" border="0" width="68" height="14">
        for small <img src="img4.gif" width="15" height="14">. We immediately recognise the double
        integrator as a possible source of difficulty for control. A simple lead
        compensator was selected for the ball position control.

        <p>The angle of the plate is controlled by a motor connected to an arm
        which is connected to the plate (as shown in the diagram above). This
        arrangement is such that the plate angle moves at half the rate of the
        angular movement of the motor. The motor is controlled via pulse width
        modulation, allowing integer speed commands in the range -127 to 127 to
        be given to the motor. The motor's maximum speed is 30 rpm.

        <p>The major obstacle to control is the several sources of non-linearity
        in the motor. Firstly, there is the obvious speed limit in the motor
        (which is an actuator saturation). Secondly, the motors appear to have a
        dead zone, which means that the motor speed must be larger than 20
        before the motor will move. Finally, there is a reasonable amount of
        backlash in the gears of the motor. (Read <a href="backlash.html">this
        page</a> for an explanation of backlash and the effect it has.) There is
        also a physical limit on the angle that the plate can tilt, but this is
        not really a problem, since the control system will be designed so as to
        not approach this limit. Assuming that the motor has no dynamics (i.e.
        the output angle is the integral of the input speed), the resulting
        model of the angle control mechanism (including a proportional
        controller with gain 2000) is

        <p align="CENTER"><img src="ball2.gif" border="0" width="584" height="93">

        <p>Overcoming the dead-zone is simple (and is described in chapter 15):
        simply add 20 to the motor speed if it is positive, or subtract 20 if
        the desired speed is negative.

        <p>Overcoming the backlash is somewhat more difficult. We closely
        monitor the desired motor speed, and if it changes direction, we drive
        the motor at maximum speed for a small period of time to overcome the
        backlash. The applet below will show that this compensation is not very
        effective. If the motor was able to rotate faster, then the backlash
        could be overcome more quickly. As it stands, the motors cannot move
        fast enough to allow any significant compensation.

        <p>The fact that the backlash is after the integrator is what makes the
        backlash so difficult to overcome. If the backlash were before the
        integrator, we could easily compensate for it by estimating the position
        of the output in the deadzone, and driving the input to overcome the
        dead zone, as described in the previous discussion of backlash. The
        backlash occurs after the integrator because the backlash affects the
        position of the motor output, not its speed. The block diagram below
        shows the system if the backlash were before the integrator.

        <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

        <p>The JAVA applet below is a simulation of the ball and plate system in
        one dimension. The graph has a vertical scale of 10cm per division and a
        horizontal scale of 2 seconds per division. It shows the position
        set-point (the blue trace), the plate angle (the green trace) and the
        ball position (the red trace).</p>

        <p>Pressing the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button allows you to
        change the set point type, the position controller C1, the angle
        controller C2 and the amount of measurement noise in the angle position
        measurement. (It is assumed that the vision system provides a noise free
        measurement of the ball position.) Also, backlash can be included in the
        model by selecting the check box, and compensation can be similarly
        enabled. Although the model has the backlash appearing after the
        integrator, the applet will allow you to change the position of the
        backlash in the simulation (this also changes the method of
        compensation). Try experimenting with these parameters.

        <p>Note that if the ball falls off the plate, the simulation will stop
        automatically. If you then press start, the simulation will reset
        itself.

        <p>The system's response is not too good, but the ball manages to stay
        on the plate (which is 0.4m wide in the simulation). This was the main
        objective of the project, but the presence of backlash severely inhibits
        the system's performance, meaning that the control is not as good as was
        desired.</p>
