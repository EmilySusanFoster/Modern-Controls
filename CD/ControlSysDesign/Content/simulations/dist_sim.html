        <h3>System Description</h3>

        <p>The process of distillation should be familiar to most readers. The
        basic concept is that we can separate a mixture of two pure liquids with
        different boiling points by heating the mixture to a temperature between
        their respective boiling points. For example, water boils at 100°C and
        ethanol boils at around 83°C at atmospheric pressure. If we heat the
        mixture to say 92°C, the ethanol will boil and be transformed into
        vapour (which is collected and condensed) while the water will remain as
        a liquid. This phenomenon is usually quantified by the relative
        volatility of the two components.<br>
        <br>
        A distillation column is used to make this process more efficient. A
        schematic diagram of a distillation column is shown below.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="distillation1.gif" border="0" width="428" height="449"></p>

        <p>The distillation column itself is made up of a series of stacked
        plates. A liquid feed containing the mixture of both liquids enters the
        column at one or more points. The liquid flows over the plates, and
        vapour bubbles up through the liquid via holes in the plates. As liquid
        travels down the column, vapour comes in contact with it many times (due
        to the multiple plates). This is the critical process in distillation
        columns. The liquid and vapour phases are brought into contact because
        as one molecule of higher boiling material converts from vapour to
        liquid phase by energy release, another molecule of the low boiling
        material utilises the free energy to convert from liquid to vapour
        phase.</p>

        <p>The base of the distillation column contains a large volume of
        liquid, which is mostly the liquid with higher boiling point (in our
        example, this would be water). Out of the base flows some of this
        liquid, some of which is heated in the reboiler and returned to the
        column. This is called the boilup, and is labeled <i>V</i>. The
        remaining liquid is the bottom product, labeled <i>B</i>.</p>

        <p>Some vapour escapes from the top of the column and is returned to a
        liquid state in the condenser. Some of this liquid is returned to the
        column as reflux <i>L</i>, and the remainder is the top product or
        distillate <i>D</i>.</p>

        <p>Vapour and liquid phases on a given plate approach thermal, pressure
        and composition equilibrium to an extent depending upon the efficiency
        of the plate.</p>

        <p>Much of the work in preparing this example was done by other people. Julio
        Rodreguez at the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of
        Sydney provided the background information for the example. Greg
        Adams at the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering,
        University of Newcastle also provided a great deal of expertise in this
        field.</p>
