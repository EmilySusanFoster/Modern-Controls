      <h3>Control Design</h3>

      <p>The control of the inverted pendulum system is very hard. As a starting
      point, consider proportional control and look at the resulting root locus.
      For positive gains <i>K</i>, the root locus is:

      <p align="center"><img src="rl1.gif" border="0" align="center" width="406" height="228">

      <p>and for negative gains:

      <p align="center"><img src="rl2.gif" border="0" align="center" width="396" height="230">

      <p>Notice that in both these plots, there is a branch of the root-locus
      that is always in the right half plane. Hence, no matter what the gain,
      the system will always be unstable, so we instantly conclude that
      proportional control is no good. We must do something to attract this
      branch of the root locus back to the left half of the complex plane. PID
      control will certainly not do this for us, since an integral term adds
      another pole at the origin.

      <p>The pole assignment control design method uses the Diophantine
      equation. This equation is:

      <p align="center"><i>L A</i> + <i>P B</i> = <i>A<sub>cl</sub></i>

      <p>where <i>A</i> has degree <i>n</i> and <i>B</i> has degree at most <i>n</i>.
      This equation can always be solved to give the controller <i>P</i> / <i>L</i>
      for the plant <i>B</i> / <i>A</i> provided that <i>P</i> and <i>L</i> have
      degree <i>n</i> - 1 and <i>A<sub>cl</sub></i> has degree 2<i>n</i> - 1.

      <p>For the inverted pendulum, we have

      <p align="center">&nbsp;
      <table align="center" border="0">
        <tr>
          <td><i>A</i> = <i>s</i><sup>4</sup> - 20<i>s</i><sup>2</sup></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><i>B</i> = 2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> - 20</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>so we must choose <i>P</i> and <i>L</i> to have degree 3 and <i>A<sub>cl</sub></i>
      to have degree 7. Now, set the desired closed-loop poles in <i>A<sub>cl</sub></i>
      at

      <p align="center">&nbsp;
      <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
          <td>-10+3<i>j</i></td>
          <td>-10-3<i>j</i></td>
          <td>-10+3<i>j</i></td>
          <td>-10-3<i>j</i></td>
          <td>-0.5</td>
          <td>-0.5</td>
          <td>-0.5</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Solving for P and L using the Sylvester matrix, we get the following
      coefficients for <i>P</i> and <i>L</i>:

      <p align="center">&nbsp;
      <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td align="center"><i>s</i><sup>3</sup></td>
          <td align="center"><i>s</i><sup>2</sup></td>
          <td align="center"><i>s</i><sup>1</sup></td>
          <td align="center"><i>s</i><sup>0</sup></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="center"><i>P</i></td>
          <td align="center">1690.5</td>
          <td align="center">7213.0</td>
          <td align="center">-472.79</td>
          <td align="center">-74.256</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align="center"><i>L</i></td>
          <td align="center">1</td>
          <td align="center">41.5</td>
          <td align="center">-2682.3</td>
          <td align="center">-8278.9</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>The root locus for the entire system is shown below.

      <p>Magnifying:

      <p align="center"><img src="rl4.gif" border="0" align="center" width="474" height="379">

      <p>Note that the controller has introduced zeros at -4.3290, 0.1366 and
      -0.0743 and poles at -75.5518, 37.0124 and -2.9606 : i.e. both the
      controller and the plant have an unstable pole and a non-minimum phase
      zero. We would thus conclude that the controller is not
      &quot;sensible&quot;, since it is not very robust. To illustrate this, try
      altering the controller in the following JAVA applet. This controller is
      very sensitive to noise due to its high gain (just look at the response in
      the presence of noise). If the system goes unstable and the angle
      approaches infinity, the pendulum will not be drawn (due to an interesting
      &quot;feature&quot; in JAVA's Math.sin), but the cart will still move
      around. To change the simulation parameters, press the &quot;Change
      Parameters&quot; button and you will be presented with a new window which
      asks you for various parameters, such as set point, noise level and the
      transfer function of the controller. The top row of numbers in this
      transfer function are the coefficients in <i>P</i> (starting with the
      coefficient of <i>s</i><sup>3</sup>) and the bottom row of numbers are the
      coefficients in <i>L</i>. You can change the position set point by simply
      typing in a different number (although I recommend steps of only 0.1m).

      <p>You should try altering the noise level to see the effect of
      measurement noise. (As a technical note, the noise level is 10 times the
      peak amplitude of the noise). The scale of the graph is such that each
      vertical division represents 0.4m. If the simulation should become
      unstable, press the &quot;Reset&quot; button. Pressing the
      &quot;Start&quot; button will start the simulation, and pressing
      &quot;Stop&quot; with stop it. You can try to come up with a better
      controller using to pole assignment method. The blue plot is the cart
      position and the green plot is the pendulum angle.

          <td align="center"><b>Things to notice</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change the noise level to 1, 0.1 and 0</td>
          <td>The pendulum jerks around much more with the higher noise level.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change the controller to achieve a better response with less
            overshoot</td>
          <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>As you may have noticed, the controller is not very good at controlling
      the cart position. Note particularly the 600% overshoot and undershoot in
      the response. Again, you might wonder whether this is due to poor control
      design or whether it is a fundamental constraint (you may wish to look at
      the inverted pendulum example in <a href="../chapters/chapter13.html">Chapter
      13</a>). You should be able to realise now that this is fundamental, and
      due to the nature of the system (i.e. a non-minimum phase zero and an
      unstable pole).

      <p>Next, we will examine what can be done if we measure angle as well as
      cart position.</p>
