      <h3>State Feedback Control</h3>

      <p>Now we will attempt to design a state feedback controller for the
      inverted pendulum system. We will design this controller under the
      assumption that both the pendulum angle and cart position can be measured.
      (Note, if we assumed that only the cart position could be measured, we
      would be facing a difficult problem as before - i.e. using a state
      feedback controller with an observer would provide us with no advantages
      over the previous design.)

      <p>The state space form of the system is:

      <p align="center"><img src="img25.gif" border="0" align="center" width="384" height="95">

      <p>Since we assume that angle and position can be measured perfectly, the <i>C</i>
      matrix for the system is

      <p align="center"><img src="img26.gif" border="0" align="center" width="150" height="54">

      <p>First, we note that the system is controllable, since the
      controllability matrix

      <p align="center"><img src="img27.gif" border="0" align="center" width="208" height="92">

      <p>is invertible. The system is also observable, so there is point in
      continuing in the design of the state feedback controller.

      <p>We first design the controller, ignoring the observer. In state
      feedback control, we set <i>f</i> = - <i>K x</i>, where <i>K</i> is the
      control matrix. The following diagram illustrates this:

      <p align="center"><img src="state1.gif" border="0" align="center" width="341" height="123">

      <p>The poles of the closed-loop system are the roots of the polynomial

      <p align="center">det(<i>s I</i> - (<i>A</i> - <i>B K</i>))

      <p>The next step is to choose the desired location of these closed loop
      poles. Arbitrarily, let the closed loop system have two poles at -1 and
      poles at -1 ± j. The <i>K</i> matrix is then found from equating the
      coefficients of powers of <i>s</i> in the desired closed-loop polynomial
      and the actual closed loop polynomial:

      <p align="center"><i>s</i><sup>4</sup> + (2<i>k</i><sub>2</sub> - 2<i>k</i><sub>4</sub>)<i>s</i><sup>3</sup>
      + (2<i>k</i><sub>1</sub> - 2<i>k</i><sub>3</sub> -20)<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>
      - 20<i>k</i><sub>2</sub><i>s</i> - 20<i>k</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>s</i><sup>4</sup>
      + 4<i>s</i><sup>3</sup> + 7<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> - 6<i>s</i> - 2

      <p>Solving this equation yields

      <p align="center"><i>K</i> = [ <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>
      <i>k</i><sub>4</sub> ] = [ -0.1 -0.3 -13.6 -2.3 ]

      <p>which is the required controller. However, not all of the state
      variables are measurable, so we must use an observer to reconstruct the
      state variables of the system from the outputs which can be measured. Due
      to the choice of state variables, this is an especially easy task in this
      case, since the variables which cannot be measured are simply the
      derivatives of the cart position and pendulum angle. Remembering that we
      cannot implement a pure derivative, the observer is

      <p align="center"><img src="img28.gif" border="0" align="center" width="128" height="116">

      <p>The diagram below shows the closed loop system including the observer.

      <p align="center"><img src="state2.gif" border="0" align="center" width="360" height="136">

      <p>The JAVA applet below shows the simulation of the closed loop state
      feedback controller/observer system. The interface is very similar to
      previous ones: use the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button to alter the
      system parameters. This time, instead of altering the transfer function of
      the controller, you change the K vector of the controller. The left-most
      text entry field represents <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> and the rightmost one <i>k</i><sub>4</sub>.
      The observer is fixed, and cannot be changed by the user.

      <p>The system state variables can also be altered instantaneously. This
      can be used to simulate step responses, since the controller will try to
      drive the system's state to zero. The state fields, in order from left to
      right, are <img src="img29.gif" border="0" valign="middle" width="56" height="21">

            much), but still much better than original controller.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Change the controller to <i>K</i> = [ -4.5 -5.7 -42 -11.7 ], which
            gives two closed loop poles at -3 and poles at -3 ± j.</td>
          <td>The cascaded system is better at attenuating measurement noise
            (even though both the angle and position measurements are noisy)</td>

      <p>Notice that the controller is as good as the previous cascade
      controller, since the same two variables are being measured. This
      controller also has similar noise rejection capabilities to the cascade
      controller.</p>
