      <h3>Observers</h3>

      <p>To estimate roll eccentricity, we view the output of the BISRA gauge
      (which is <i>h</i> + <i>e</i>) as the eccentricity <i>e</i> plus some
      noise. Before we can use an observer to estimate the roll eccentricity, we
      need to model it. As before, this model is chosen to be a single sinewave
      of period 200ms. A suitable &quot;system&quot; for this sinewave of
      frequency <i>w</i> is

      <p align="center"><img src="img37.gif" border="0" alt width="360" height="54">

      <p>The output of this &quot;system&quot; is simply <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>
      (so <i>C</i> = [ 1 0 ]). We can then design an observer

      <p align="center"><img src="img40.gif" border="0" alt width="85" height="54">

      <p>for this system to estimate the state variables of the system:

      <p align="center"><img src="img38.gif" border="0" alt width="203" height="37">

      <p>The closed loop characteristic polynomial of this observer is

      <p align="center"><img src="img39.gif" border="0" alt width="134" height="33">

      <p>and using this equation with the desired characteristic polynomial, we
      can place the observer poles at the desired locations. Alternatively, we
      can use the Kalman filter equation to find the optimal <i>J</i>. As a
      starting point, choose <i>J</i><sub>1</sub> = 120 and <i>J</i><sub>2</sub>
      = 0.

      <p>Once we have this estimate of eccentricity (i.e. the estimated <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>),
      we can subtract it from the output of the BISRA gauge to give the new
      estimate of exit thickness:

      <p align="center"><img src="img41.gif" border="0" alt width="98" height="38">

      <p>To improve performance further, we then emulate disturbance feedforward
      by subtracting the estimated eccentricity from the controller output <i>u</i>.

      <p>This leads us to the following model for the closed loop system:

      <p align="center"><img src="rolling6a.gif" border="0" alt width="596" height="321">
      <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

      <p>The JAVA applet below is a simulation of the above system. The control
      parameters have been chosen as <i>k<sub>p</sub></i> = 20 and <i>k<sub>i</sub></i>
      = 200. The graph has a vertical scale of 0.1mm per division and as in the
      previous simulation, the horizontal scale of the graph can be altered by
      the user. It shows the set-point (the blue trace), the actual exit
      thickness <i>h</i> (the green trace) and the estimated eccentricity signal
      centred around 0.6mm (the red trace). Normally, the eccentricity is
      centred around 0, but the plot of it was shifted because the vertical axis
      of the graph is from 0 to 0.8.</p>

      <p>Pressing the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button allows you to change
      the same parameters as in the previous simulation, plus the amplitude of
      the eccentricity signal and the observer gain matrix <i>J</i>.

          <td>The delay has no effect on the set-point or disturbance responses
            (but the sudden change causes the eccentricity estimate to be
            incorrect</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change the time scale on the graph to 2 sec/div and compare the
            magnitude of the sinusoidal variations to the previous examples</td>
          <td>The eccentricity of the rolls has almost no effect on the output</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Redesign the observer using the Kalman filter equation</td>
          <td>Better observer performance can be achieved, but the effect of the
            rapid output changes on the eccentricity estimate cannot be removed</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>This simulation shows that with the observer, the effect of roll
      ecentricity is vastly reduced. In fact, for an eccentricity of 0.03, the
      effect on the output is 0.0024, which represents a 92% reduction, which is
      quite respectable considering the uncontrolled system performs a 66%
      reduction. The effect of the eccentricity signal could only be zero if (1)
      we had an always perfect estimate of eccentricity and (2) we could
      subtract the estimated eccentricity directly from <i>s</i> (which is not
      possible since we can only control <i>u</i>). Thus, the filtering effect
      of the time constant of the screw position means that the eccentricity
      will always have some effect.</p>

      <p>You may have observed the oscillation in both the set-point response
      and the disturbance response. This is due to the inaccuracies of the
      eccentricity estimation at these points (a fact easily observed from the
      graph of estimated eccentricity). The observer will see a change in its
      input signal, and will take some small amount of time to correct for this.</p>

      <p>As we have seen with the progression of these simulations, as we delve
      deeper into the control problem, we can achieve better performance using
      more sophisticated methods from control science. However, with each
      solution comes a new limit on performance (which is better than the
      previous limit), and hence a new problem to be solved. As you may have
      guessed, the Kalman filter solution (allowing increased system bandwidth)
      is by no means the final solution - there exists a phenomenon known as the
      &quot;hold-up effect&quot; which prevents the system from achieving the
      promised 10ms response time. This is addressed (particularly in relation
      to reversing mills - <a href="../images/rolling_mill2.jpg">photo</a>) in
      Section 9.8 (page 242) of the book. Even after this problem is solved,
      there are further, more complex ones awaiting.</p>

      <p>This concludes the interactive demonstration of rolling mill control.</p>
