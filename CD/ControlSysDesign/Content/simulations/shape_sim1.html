      <h3>System Model</h3>

      <p>The model for the system is shown in the block diagram below, where <b>U</b>
      vector of spray valve positions and <b>Y</b> is the roll thickness vector.
      (The bold lines indicate vectors rather than single signals).</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="shape1.gif" border="0" align="center" width="379" height="142">

      <p>The sprays affect the roll as described by the matrix <b>M</b> below.

      <p align="center"><img src="shape2.gif" border="0" align="center" width="200" height="150">

      <p>The parameter <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="img4.gif" alt="alpha" width="15" height="14">
      represents the level of interactivity in the system, and is determined by
      the number of sprays present, and how close together they are.

      <p>This matrix has a simple inverse as shown below.

      <p align="center"><img src="shape3.gif" border="0" align="center" width="296" height="171">

      <p>Using this matrix to decouple the system amounts to turning off
      surrounding sprays when a spray is turned on.

      <p>So we can decouple the system simply by multiplying the control vector
      by this inverse. This set up is shown in the block diagram below.

      <p align="center"><img src="shape4.gif" border="0" align="center" width="379" height="142">

      <p>The controller is then a set of simple PI controllers linking each
      shape meter with the corresponding spray. (We assume that the shape meters
      measure the shape of the rolls perfectly).

      <p>It may at this stage seem that adding more sprays will give finer
      control of the roll shape. However, as more sprays are added, <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="img4.gif" alt="alpha" width="15" height="14">
      approaches 1. The system is then less robust, since the matrix <b>M</b> is
      almost all 1s, and the inverse of <b>M</b> has very large numbers. The
      system is then very sensitive to errors in the estimation of alpha, due to
      the large gains present in <b>M</b><sup>-1</sup>.
      <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

      <p>The JAVA applet below is a simulation of the shape control system.
      There are 10 sprays, and the graph has a vertical scale of 1mm per
      division and a horizontal scale of 2 seconds per division. It shows the
      position set-point (the blue trace) and five of the rolling mill
      thicknesses (the other colours).

      <p>Pressing the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button allows you to change
      the set-point type. &quot;Uniform&quot; means that the set-point is
      uniform across the roll, &quot;Square&quot; means that the set-point is a
      step across the roll, and &quot;Point&quot; means that a single point on
      the roll has the changing set-point. The parameter window also allows you
      to change the PI controller parameters and the amount of measurement noise
      in the shape meters. The decoupling compensation (the inverse of <b>M</b>)
      can be enabled or disabled through the check box. Also, the parameter <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="img4.gif" alt="alpha" width="15" height="14">
      can be altered to change the level of interactivity between the sprays. If
      you check the &quot;Reset roll to default state&quot; box, the roll shape
      will be reset to its (bumpy) initial shape. Try experimenting with these
      parameters.

            response.
        <tr>
          <td>Disable the decoupling and change the set point to
            &quot;Square&quot; and then &quot;Uniform&quot;</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Enable the decoupling (resetting the roll shape)</td>
          <td>Notice the improved (i.e. both faster and completely decoupled)
            response, particularly in the square set point.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Change the value of alpha (the interactivity parameter) with
            decoupling disabled (Ensure that alpha &lt; 1 or instability
            results)</td>
          <td>Notice that lower alpha values improve the response, and alpha = 0
            is equivalent to enabling decoupling.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Note that in this simulation, we were applying step set-point changes.
      In practise, the set point is fixed, but output disturbances occur.
      Applying step set-point changes is similar to applying step output
      disturbances, as a very similar type of response would be seen.

      <p>The decoupling method works extremely well. The highly interactive
      system becomes completely decoupled, allowing control using simple PI
      controllers. Next, we examine the effect of saturation levels on the
      valves.</p>
