      <h3>Saturation Effects</h3>

      <p>The previous simulations assumed that the spray valves could be opened
      infinitely, and also assumed that the sprays could somehow suck water back
      into the spray when required. Clearly, these are not realistic
      assumptions, since the valves have physical saturation levels.</p>

      <p>The block diagram of the system with this actuator saturation in place
      is shown below:

      <p align="center"><img src="shape5.gif" border="0" align="center" width="400" height="150">

      <p>The saturation can cause integrator windup in the PI controller, so we
      use the anti-windup controller from chapter 15:

      <p align="center"><img src="shape6.gif" border="0" align="center" width="450" height="150">

      <p>This controller form reduces the overshoot in the step response, but
      interferes with the decoupling, since the saturation occurs after the
      matrix inversion.
      <h3>Java Applet Simulation</h3>

      <p>The JAVA applet below is a simulation of the saturated shape control
      system. It is almost identical to the previous simulation, except the
      decoupling mechanism is always enabled.</p>

      <p>As before, pressing the &quot;Change Parameters&quot; button allows you
      to change the set point type, the PI controller parameters, and the amount
      of measurement noise in the shape meters. The anti-windup controller can
      be enabled or disabled through the check box. Also, the parameter <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="img4.gif" alt="alpha" width="15" height="14">
      can be altered to change the level of interactivity between the sprays. If
      you check the &quot;Reset roll to default state&quot; box, the roll shape
      will be reset to its (bumpy) initial shape. Try experimenting with these
      parameters.

            simulation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

      <p>The saturation of the spray valves interferes noticably with the
      decoupling. This suggests that a more sophisticated control strategy is
      needed to overcome these difficulties. The problem is that the saturation
      does not allow the decoupling matrix to work effectively. One method of
      overcoming this would be to scale the error for each PI controller, so
      that the controller output is never larger than the saturation limit. This
      ensures that the decoupling will work, since the valve saturation will
      have no effect on the control signal (since it is already within the
      saturation limits). However, such a control strategy is difficult to
      implement. This highlights the difficulties posed by non-linearities in
      MIMO systems.</p>
