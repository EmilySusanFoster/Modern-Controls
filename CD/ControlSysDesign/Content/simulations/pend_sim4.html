      <p>Below is a JAVA simulation of the cascade inverted pendulum system. You
      can adjust the simulation parameters by pressing the &quot;Change
      Parameters&quot; button, which asks for the set point, the noise level and
      the transfer functions of both controllers (C1 is the outer loop
      controller and C2 is the inner loop controller). The transfer functions
      are represented by their coefficients, with the top row being the
      numerator coefficients and the bottom row the denominator coefficients.
      This time, set point changes of -0.5m to +0.5m will ensure that the
      pendulum stays visible on the screen.

      <p>The scale of the graph is such that each vertical division represents
      0.4m. If the simulation should become unstable, press the
      &quot;Reset&quot; button. (As a technical note, the noise level is 10
      times the peak amplitude of the cart position measurement noise, and 100
      times the peak amplitude of the angle measurement noise. This is because
      the angle measurement is on a smaller scale.)

            (even though both the angle and position measurements are noisy)</td>

      <p>This cascaded system is much better at controlling the inverted
      pendulum system. The overshoot/undershoot for this system is around 20%,
      which is much better than the 600% overshoot/undershoot in previous
      response. Also, note the much better noise rejection in this system due to
      the lower bandwidth. This system performs better at a noise level of 1
      than the previous system did at a noise level of 0.1 (see for yourself!).

      <p>Next, we will examine the use of state feedback control with the use of
      an observer.</p>
