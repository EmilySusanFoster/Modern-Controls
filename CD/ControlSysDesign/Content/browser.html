    <tr>
      <td>You are here : <a href="index.html" target="_top">Control System
        Design - Index</a> | Browser Information
        <h2 align="center">A Note About Web Browsers</h2>

        <p>I have personally tested the Java applets on this site with the
        following browsers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Netscape Communicator 4.05 (Unix)
          <li>Netscape Communicator 4.08 (Windows)
          <li>Netscape Communicator 4.5 (Windows)
          <li>Netscape Communicator 4.61 (Windows)</li>
          <li>Internet Explorer 3.0 (Windows)
          <li>Internet Explorer 4.01 (Windows)</li>
          <li>Internet Explorer 5.0 (Windows)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I assume that the site will work correctly with other Netscape 4.0x
        browsers. I have heard that the site works fine with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Netscape Navigator 2.02 (Windows).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Great effort has been made to ensure compatibility with as many
        browsers as possible, but some browser bugs just can't be worked around:</p>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Netscape 4.08 (Unix)</td>
            <td>This version of Netscape seems to crash quite regularly when
              running Java applets (try pressing reload when a Java applet is on
              the screen), and not just the Java applets on this page. (A Java
              applet should <b>never</b> be able to crash the browser)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Netscape 3.04 (Windows)</td>
            <td>The Java implementation in this browser seems a little
              &quot;strange&quot;, with various functions missing from the API!
              Some of the applets seem to work fine, but others don't and can
              even cause Netscape to crash</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>However, if you do run the applets with these browsers and have no
        troubles, then I'd like to hear about it - send me 
	an email (nathan@ee.newcastle.edu.au) telling me about your system 
	and the exact version of your browser.</p>

        <p>If you are running LYNX, then I really do pity you, but there's not
        much I can do for you in the way of interactive demos. You should still
        be able to view most of the content, however most of the equations used
        on the site are graphic images.</p>
