        Preface (English)</p>
        <h2 align="center">Preface</h2>

        <p>Control Engineering plays a fundamental role in modern technological
        systems. The benefits of improved control in industry can be immense.
        They include improved product quality, reduced energy consumption,
        minimization of waste materials, increased safety levels and reduction
        of pollution.</p>

        <p>However, a difficulty with the subject is that some of the more
        advanced aspects depend on sophisticated mathematical background.
        Arguably, mathematical systems theory is one of the most significant
        achievements of twentieth century science. However, its practical impact
        is only as good as the benefits it can bring. Thus, in this book, we aim
        to strike a balance which places strong emphasis on design.</p>

        <p>It was the author's involvement in several industrial control system
        design projects that provided part of the motivation to write this book.
        In a typical industrial problem, we found ourselves investigating fluid
        and thermal dynamics, experiencing the detrimental effects of
        non-constant PLC scan rates, dealing with system integration and network
        communication protocols, building trust with plant operators and
        investigating safe bumpless transfer schemes for testing tentative
        control designs on potentially dangerous plants. In short, we
        experienced the day-to-day excitement, frustration, set-backs and
        progress in getting advanced control to contribute to a commercial
        company's bottom line. This is not an easy task. Moreover, success in
        this type of venture typically depends on the application of a wide
        range of multidisciplinary skills. However, it is rewarding and exciting
        work for those who do it.</p>

        <p>One of the main aims of this book is to share this excitement with
        our readers. We hope to contribute to the development of skills and
        attitudes within readers and students that will better equip them to
        face the challenges of real-world design problems. The book is thus
        intended to contribute to the ongoing reform of the Control Engineering
        curriculum. This topic is receiving considerable international
        attention. For example, a recent issue of IEEE Control Systems Magazine
        features an entire special section devoted to this theme.</p>

        <p>However, reforming the curriculum will not be done by books alone -
        it will be done by people; by students, by teachers, by researchers, by
        practitioners, by publication and grant reviewers; and by market
        pressures. Moreover, for these efforts to be efficient and sustainable,
        the control engineering community will need to communicate their
        experiences via a host of new books, laboratories, simulations and
        web-based resources. Thus, there will be a need for several different
        and complementary approaches. In this context, the authors believe that
        this book will have been successful if it contributes, in some way, to
        the revitalization of interest by students in the exciting discipline of
        control engineering.</p>

        <p>We stress that this is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book. On the
        contrary, we provide a comprehensive, yet condensed, presentation of
        rigorous control engineering. We employ, and thus require, mathematics
        as a means to <em>model</em> the process, <em>analyze</em> its
        properties under feedback, synthesize a controller with particular
        properties and arrive at a design addressing the inherent trade-offs and
        constraints applicable to the problem.</p>

        <p>In particular, we believe that success in control projects depends on
        two key ingredients: (i) having a comprehensive understanding of the
        process itself, gained by studying the relevant physics, chemistry,
        etc.; and (ii) by having mastery of the fundamental concepts of signals,
        systems and feedback. The first ingredient typically occupies more than
        fifty per cent of the effort. It is an inescapable component of the
        complete design cycle. However, it is impractical for us to give full
        details the processes to which control might be applied since it covers
        chemical plants, electromechanical systems, robots, power generators,
        etc. We thus emphasize the fundamental control engineering aspects that
        are common to all applications and leave readers to complement this with
        process knowledge relevant to their particular problem. Thus, the book
        is principally aimed at the second ingredient of control engineering. Of
        course, we do give details of several real world examples so as to put
        the methods into a proper context.</p>

        <p>The central theme of this book is continuous-time control. However we
        also treat digital control in detail, since most modern control systems
        will usually be implemented on some form of computer hardware. This
        approach inevitably led to a book of larger volume then originally
        intended but with the advantage of providing a comprehensive treatment
        within an integrated framework. Naturally, there remain specialized
        topics that are not covered in the book. However, we trust that we
        provide a sufficiently strong foundation so that the reader can
        comfortably turn to the study of appropriate complementary literature.</p>

        <p>Thus, in writing this book we chose our mission as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>accessible treatment of rigorous material selected with
            applicability in mind,
          <li>early emphasis on design, that is, understanding, and dealing
            with, inherent constraints,
          <li>numerous industrial case studies, and
          <li>motivation provided by substantial interactive web-based support.
        </ul>

        <p>Design is a complex process, which requires judgment and iteration.
        The design problem is normally incompletely specified, sometimes
        ill-defined, and many times without solution. A key element in design is
        an understanding of those factors which limit the achievable
        performance. This naturally leads to a viewpoint of control design which
        takes account of these fundamental limitations. This viewpoint is a
        recurring theme throughout the book.</p>

        <p>Our objective is not to explore the full depth of mathematical
        completeness but instead to give enough detail so that a reader can
        begin applying the ideas as soon as possible. This approach is connected
        to our assumption that readers will have ready access to modern
        computational facilities including the software package MATLAB-SIMULINK.
        This assumption allows us to put the emphasis on fundamental ideas
        rather than on the tools. Every chapter includes worked examples and
        problems for the reader.</p>

        <p>The book is divided into eight parts. A brief summary of each of the
        parts is given below:</p>

        <p><b>Part 1: The Elements</b><br>
        This part covers basic continuous time signals and systems and would be
        suitable for an introductory course on this topic. Alternatively it
        could be used to provide revision material before starting the study of
        control in earnest.</p>

        <p><b>Part II: SISO Control Essentials</b><br>
        This part deals with basic SISO control including classical PID tuning.
        This, together with part 1, covers the content of many of the existing
        curricula for basic control courses.</p>

        <p><b>Part III: SISO Control Design</b><br>
        This part covers design issues in SISO Control. We consider many of
        these ideas to be crucial to achieving success in practical control
        problems. In particular, we believe the chapter dealing with constraints
        should be mentioned, if at all possible, in all introductory courses.
        Also feedforward and cascade structures, which are covered in this part,
        are very frequently employed in practice.</p>

        <p><b>Part IV: Digital Computer Control</b><br>
        This part covers material essential to the understanding of digital
        control. We go beyond traditional treatments of this topic by studying
        inter-sample issues.</p>

        <p><b>Part V: Advanced SISO Control</b><br>
        This part could be the basis of a second course on control at an
        undergraduate level. It is aimed at the introduction of ideas that flow
        through to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems later in the book.</p>

        <p><b>Part VI: MIMO Control Essentials</b><br>
        This part gives the basics required for a junior level graduate course
        on MIMO control. In particular, this part covers basic MIMO system's
        theory. It also shows how one can exploit SISO methods in some MIMO
        design problems.</p>

        <p><b>Part VII: MIMO Control Design</b><br>
        This part describes tools and ideas that can be used in industrial MIMO
        design. In particular, it includes linear quadratic optimal control
        theory and optimal filtering. These two topics have major significance
        in applications. We also include a chapter on Model Predictive Control.
        We believe this to be important material because of the widespread use
        of this technique in industrial applications.</p>

        <p><b>Part VIII: Advanced MIMO Control</b><br>
        This final part of the book could be left for private study. It is
        intended to test the readers understanding of the other material by
        examining advanced issues. Alternatively instructors could use this part
        to extend parts VI and VII in a more senior graduate course on MIMO
        Control.</p>

        <p>Two of the authors (Goodwin and Salgado) have taught undergraduate
        and postgraduate courses of the type mentioned above using draft
        versions of this book in both Australia and South America.</p>

        <p>The material in the book is illustrated by several industrial case
        studies with which the authors have had direct involvement. These case
        studies have been carried out, in collaboration with industry, by the
        Centre for Integrated Dynamics and Control (CIDAC) (a Commonwealth
        Special Research Centre) at the University of Newcastle or at OMV ( a
        petrochemical Company in Austria where the second author (Graebe) is
        Control Engineer Manager.</p>

        <p>The projects that we have chosen to describe include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Satellite tracking
          <li>pH control
          <li>Control of a continuous casting machine
          <li>Sugar mill control
          <li>Distillation column control
          <li>Ammonia synthesis plant control
          <li>Zinc coating mass estimation in continuous galvanizing line
          <li>BISRA gauge for thickness control in rolling mills
          <li>Roll eccentricity compensation in rolling mills
          <li>Hold-up effect in reversing rolling mills
          <li>Flatness control in steel rolling
          <li>Vibration control
        </ul>

        <p>Many of the case studies have also been repeated, and further
        embellished, on the book's web page where Java applets are provided so
        that readers can experiment with the systems in the form of a
        &quot;virtual laboratory&quot;. A secondary advantage of having the case
        studies gathered in one place on the web page is that real control
        problems usually bring together many aspects and thus it is difficult to
        localize them in the book. The web page thus gives a more holistic view
        of the issues involved in the case studies.</p>

        <p>In addition, we refer to several laboratory scale control problems
        including a ball and plate mechanism, coupled tanks apparatus, and
        inverted pendulum. Each of these is the basis of a laboratory experiment
        within our universities to illustrate control principles.</p>
