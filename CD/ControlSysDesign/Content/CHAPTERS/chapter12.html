        <h2 align="center">12. Models for Sampled Data Systems</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>Modern control systems are almost always implemented in a digital
        computer. It is thus important to have an appreciation of the impact of
        implementing a particular control law in digital form. In this chapter
        we provide the fundamental modeling tools necessary to describe the
        sampled response of continuous-time plants. The main topics included
        are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discrete-time signals</li>
          <li>Z-transforms and Delta transforms</li>
          <li>Sampling and reconstruction</li>
          <li>Aliasing and anti-aliasing filters</li>
          <li>Sampled-data control systems</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is common in many courses on control to either treat sampling at a
        much later point or even to move it to a separate course specifically
        devoted to digital control. However, our view is that there is so much
        in common between continuous and digital control, that one can introduce
        sampling ideas early and then, essentially, present both ideas
        simultaneously.</p>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Very few plants encountered by the control engineer are digital,
            most are continuous. That is, the control signal applied to the
            process, as well as the measurements received from the process, are
            usually continuous time.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Modern control systems, however, are almost exclusively
            implemented on digital computers.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Compared to the historical analog controller implementation, the
            digital computer provides</li>
          <ul>
            <li>much greater ease of implementing complex algorithms,</li>
            <li>convenient (graphical) man-machine interfaces,</li>
            <li>logging, trending and diagnostics of internal controller and</li>
            <li>flexibility to implement filtering and other forms of signal
              processing operations.<br>
              &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Digital computers operate with sequences in time, rather than
            continuous functions in time.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Therefore,
            <ul>
              <li>input signals to the digital controller-notably process
                measurements - must be sampled;</li>
              <li>outputs from the digital controller-notably control signals -
                must be interpolated from a digital sequence of values to a
                continuous function in time.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sampling (see Figure 12.7) is carried out by A/D (analog to
            digital) converters.</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="part4-fig1.gif" width="471" height="145"></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The converse, reconstructing a continuous time signal from digital
            samples, is carried out by D/A (digital to analog) converters. There
            are different ways of interpolating between the discrete samples,
            but the so called zero-order hold (see Figure 12.8) is by far the
            most common.</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="part4-fig2.gif" width="470" height="155"></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When sampling a continuous time signal,
            <ul>
              <li>an appropriate sampling rate must be chosen</li>
              <li>an anti-aliasing filter (low-pass) should be included to avoid
                frequency folding.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Analysis of digital systems relies on discrete time versions of
            the continuous operators.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The chapter has introduced two discrete operators:
            <ul>
              <li>the shift operator, <i>q</i>, defined by 
                <!-- MATH: $qx[k]\stackrel{\rm\triangle}{=}x[k+1]$ -->
                <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part4-img6.gif" alt="$qx[k]\stackrel{\rm\triangle}{=}x[k+1]$" width="113" height="46"></li>
              <li>the <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">-operator,
                <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">,
                defined by
      
                <!-- MATH: $\delta x[k]\stackrel{\rm\triangle}{=}\dfrac{ x[k+1]-x[k]}{\Delta}$ -->
                <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part4-img8.gif" alt="$\delta x[k]\stackrel{\rm\triangle}{=}\dfrac{ x[k+1]-x[k]}{\Delta} $" width="163" height="53"><br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Thus, 
            <!-- MATH: $\delta =\dfrac{q-1}\Delta$ -->
            <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part4-img9.gif" alt="$\delta =\dfrac{q-1}\Delta $" width="71" height="49">,
            or 
            <!-- MATH: $q=\delta \Delta +1.$ -->
            <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part4-img10.gif" alt="$q=\delta \Delta +1.$" width="85" height="29"><br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Due to this conversion possibility, the choice is largely based on
            preference and experience. Comparisons are outlined below.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The shift operator, <i>q</i>,
            <ul>
              <li>is the traditional operator;</li>
              <li>is the operator many engineers feel more familiar with;</li>
              <li>is used in the majority of the literature.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">-operator,
            <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">,
            has the advantages of:
            <ul>
              <li>emphasizing the link between continuous and discrete systems
                (resembles a differential);</li>
              <li><img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">-expressions
                converge to familiar continuous expressions as 
                <!-- MATH: $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ -->
                <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img11.gif" alt="$\Delta \rightarrow 0$" width="49" height="15">,
                which is intuitive;</li>
              <li>is numerically vastly superior at fast sampling rates when
                properly implemented.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Analysis of digital systems relies on discrete time versions of
            the continuous operators:
            <ul>
              <li>the discrete version of the differential operator is a
                difference operator;</li>
              <li>the discrete version of the Laplace transform is either the
                Z-transform (associated with the shift operator) or the <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part4-img12.gif" alt="$\gamma
$" width="12" height="28">-transform (associated with the <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">-operator).<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>With the help of these operators,
            <ul>
              <li>continuous time differential equation models can be converted
                to discrete time difference equation models;</li>
              <li>continuous time transfer or state space models can be
                converted to discrete time transfer or state space models in
                either the shift or <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">
                operators.</li>
