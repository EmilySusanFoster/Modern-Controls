        <h2 align="center">6. Classical PID Control</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p align="left">In this chapter we review a particular control structure
        that has become almost universally used in industrial control. It is
        based on a particular fixed structure controller family, the so-called,
        PID controller family. They have proven to be robust in the control of
        many important applications.</p>

        <p align="left">The simplicity of these controllers is also their
        weakness, since it limits the range of plants that they can control
        satisfactorily. Indeed, there exists a set of unstable plants which
        cannot even be stabilized with any member of the PID family.
        Nevertheless, the surprising versatility of PID control (really, PID
        control simply means: control with an up to second-order controller)
        ensures continued relevance and popularity for this controller. It is
        also important to view this second-order setting as a special case of
        modern design methods, as presented, for example, in Chapters 7 and 15.
        This chapter covers the classical approaches to PID design. This is done
        due to the historical and practical significance of the methods and
        their continued use in industry.</p>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>PI and PID controllers are widely used in industrial control.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>It has been empirically found that the PID structure often has
            sufficient flexibility to yield excellent results in many
            applications.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The basic term is the proportional term, <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part2-img18.gif" alt="${\bf P}$" width="16" height="14">,
            which cause a corrective control actuation proportional to the
            error.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The integral term, <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part2-img19.gif" alt="${\bf I}$" width="10" height="14">,
            gives a correction proportional to the integral of the error. This
            has the positive feature of ultimately ensuring that sufficient
            control effort is applied to reduce the tracking error to zero.
            However, integral action tends to have a destabilizing effect due to
            the increased phase shift.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The derivative term, <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part2-img20.gif" alt="${\bf D}$" width="17" height="14">,
            gives a predictive capability yielding a control action proportional
            to the rate of change of the error. This tends to have a stabilizing
            effect but often leads to large control movements due to the
            amplification of noise by the derivative action.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Various empirical tuning methods can be used to determine the PID
            parameters for a given application. They should be considered as a
            first guess in a search procedure. Attention should also be paid to
            the PID structure. Systematic model-based procedures are covered in
            later chapters.</li>
