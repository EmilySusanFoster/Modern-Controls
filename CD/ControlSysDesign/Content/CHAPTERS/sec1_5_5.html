        <h3>1.5.5 Communications</h3>

        <p>Interconnecting sensors to actuators, involves the use of
        communication systems. A typical plant can have many thousands of
        separate signals to be sent over long distances. Thus the design of
        communication systems and their associated protocols is an increasingly
        important aspect of modern control engineering.</p>

        <p>There are special issues and requirements for communication systems
        with real time data. For example, in voice communication, small delays
        and imperfections in transmission are often unimportant since they are
        transparent to the recipient. However, in high speed real time control
        systems, these issues could be of major importance. For example, there
        is an increasing tendency to use Ethernet type connections for data
        transmission in control. However, as is well known by those familiar
        with this technology, if a delay occurs on the transmission line, then
        the transmitter simply &quot;tries again&quot; at some later random
        time. This obviously introduces a non-deterministic delay into the
        transmission of the data. Since all control systems depend upon precise
        knowledge of, not only <em>what</em> has happened, but <em>when</em> it
        happened, attention to such delays is very important for the performance
        of the overall system.</p>
