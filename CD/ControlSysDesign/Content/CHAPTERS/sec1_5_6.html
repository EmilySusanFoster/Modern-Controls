        <h3>1.5.6 Computing</h3>

        <p>In modern control systems, the connection between sensors and
        actuators is invariably made via a computer of some sort. Thus, computer
        issues are necessarily part of the overall design. Current control
        systems use a variety of computational devices including DCS's
        (Distributed Control Systems), PLC's (Programmable Logic Controllers),
        PC's (Personal Computers), etc. In some cases, these computer elements
        may be rather limited with respect to the facilities they offer. As with
        communication delays, computational delays can be crucial to success or
        failure in the operation of control systems. Since, determinism in
        timing is important, a multi-tasking real-time operating system may be
        required.</p>

        <p>Another aspect of computing is that of numerical precision. We know
        of several control systems that failed to meet the desired performance
        specifications simply because of inadequate attention to numerical
        issues. For this reason, we will devote some attention to this issue in
        the sequel.</p>

        <p>A final computer based question in control concerns the ease of
        design and implementation. Modern computer aided tools for rapid
        prototyping of control systems provide integrated environments for
        control system modeling, design, simulation and implementation. These
        &quot;pictures to real time code&quot; facilities have allowed
        development times for advanced control algorithms to be reduced from
        many months to the order of days or, in some cases, hours.</p>
