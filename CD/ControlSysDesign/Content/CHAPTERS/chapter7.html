        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p align="left">In Chapter 5 it was shown how feedback control loop
        performance and stability can be characterized using a set of four
        sensitivity functions. A key feature of these functions is that all of
        them have poles belonging to the same set, the set of <b>closed loop
        poles</b>. Hence, this set determines stability and the natural modes of
        the closed loop. A key synthesis question is therefore: given a model, <em>can
        one systematically synthesize a controller such that the closed loop
        poles are in predefined locations?</em> This chapter will show that this
        is indeed possible. We call this<b> pole assignment</b>, which is a
        fundamental idea in control synthesis.</p>

        <p align="left">In this chapter we will use a polynomial description.
        This evolves naturally from the analysis in Chapter 5. In a later
        chapter we will use a state space description. This will provide a
        natural transition from SISO to MIMO control systems in later chapters.</p>

        <p align="left">It is also shown how both approaches can accommodate
        other design requirements such as zero steady state tracking errors and
        disturbance rejection.</p>

        <p align="left">Finally, PID controllers are placed into this general
        framework and it is shown how they may be synthesized using pole
        assignment methods.</p>

        <p align="left">The question of how to choose a set of values for the
        closed loop poles to meet the required performance specifications is, of
        course, a crucial issue. This is actually a non-trivial question which
        needs to be considered as part of the intricate web of design trade-offs
        associated with all feedback loops. The latter will be taken up in the
        next chapter, where the design problem will be analyzed.</p>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>This chapter addresses the question of synthesis and asks:<br>
            Given the model 
            <!-- MATH: $G_0(s)=\frac{B_o(s)}{A_o(s)}$ -->
            <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part2-img21.gif" alt="$G_0(s)=\frac{B_o(s)}{A_o(s)}$" width="100" height="40">,
            how can one synthesize a controller,
  
            <!-- MATH: $C(s)=\frac{P(s)}{L(s)}$ -->
            <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part2-img4.gif" alt="$C(s)=\frac{P(s)}{L(s)}$" width="86" height="40">
            such that the closed loop has a particular property.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Recall:
            <ul>
              <li>the poles have a profound impact on the dynamics of a transfer
                function;</li>
              <li>The poles of the four sensitivities governing the closed loop
                belong to the same set, namely the roots of the characteristic
                equation 
                <!-- MATH: $A_o(s)L(s)+B_o(s)P(s)=0$ -->
                <i>A</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<i>L</i>(<i>s</i>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>B</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>s</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Therefore, a key synthesis question is: Given a model, can one
            synthesize a controller such that the closed loop poles (i.e.
            sensitivity poles) are in pre-defined locations?<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Stated mathematically:<br>
            Given polynomials 
            <!-- MATH: $A_o(s),B_o(s)$ -->
            <i>A</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>),<i>B</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)
            (defining the model) and given a polynomial <i>A</i><sub><i>cl</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)
            (defining the desired location of closed loop poles), is it possible
            to find polynomials <i>P</i>(<i>s</i>) and <i>L</i>(<i>s</i>) such
            that 
            <!-- MATH: $A_o(s)L(s)+B_o(s)P(s)=A_{cl}(s)$ -->
            <i>A</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<i>L</i>(<i>s</i>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>B</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>s</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i><sub><i>cl</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)?
            This chapter shows that this is indeed possible.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The equation 
            <!-- MATH: $A_o(s)L(s)+B_o(s)P(s)=A_{cl}(s)$ -->
            <i>A</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<i>L</i>(<i>s</i>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>B</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>s</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A</i><sub><i>cl</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)
            is known as a Diophantine equation.<a name="571"><br>
            </a>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Controller synthesis by solving the Diophantine equation is known
            as <i>pole placement</i>. There are several efficient algorithms as
            well as commercial software to do so.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Synthesis ensures that the emergent closed loop has particular
            constructed properties.
            <ul>
              <li>However, the overall system performance is determined by a
                number of further properties which are <i>consequences</i> of
                the constructed property.</li>
              <li>The coupling of constructed and consequential properties
                generates trade-offs.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Design is concerned with
            <ul>
              <li>efficiently detecting if there is no solution that meets the
                design specifications adequately and what the inhibiting factors
                are</li>
              <li>choosing the constructed properties such that, whenever
                possible, the overall behavior emerging from the interacting
                constructed and the consequential properties meets the design
                specifications adequately.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
