        <p>As mentioned in Chapter 11, all real world control problems are
        subject to constraints of various types. The most common constraints are
        actuator constraints (amplitude and slew rate limits). In addition, many
        problems also have constraints on state variables (e.g. maximal
        pressures that cannot be exceeded, minimum tank levels etc).</p>

        <p>In many design problems, these constraints can be ignored, at least
        in the initial design phase. However, in other problems, these
        constraints are an inescapable part of the problem formulation since the
        system operates near a constraint boundary. Indeed, in many process
        control problems the optimal steady state operating point is frequently
        at a constraint boundary. In these cases, it is desirable to be able to
        carry out the design so as to include the constraints from the
        beginning.</p>

        <p>Chapter 11 described methods for dealing with constraints based on
        anti-windup strategies. These are probably adequate for simple problems
        - especially SISO problems. Also, these methods can be extended to
        certain MIMO problems as we shall see later in Chapter 25. However, in
        more complex MIMO problems - especially those having both input and
        state constraints, it is desirable to have a more formal mechanism for
        dealing with constraints in MIMO control system design.</p>

        <p>We describe one such mechanism here based on Model Predictive
        Control. This has actually been a major success story in the application
        of modern control. More than 2,000 applications of this method have been
        reported in the literature - predominantly in the petrochemical area.
        Also, the method is being increasingly used in electromechanical control
        problems as control systems push constraint boundaries. Its main
        advantages are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it provides a &quot;one-stop-shop&quot; for MIMO control in the
            presence of constraints,</li>
          <li>it is one of the few methods that allow one to treat state
            constraints, and</li>
          <li>several commercial packages are available which give industrially
            robust versions of the algorithms aimed at chemical process control.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here we will give a brief introduction to the method reflecting the
        authors' experience. One of us (Graebe) has considerable practical
        experience with mpc in his industry where it is credited with enabling
        very substantial annual financial savings through improved control
        performance.</p>
