        <h2 align="center">The Excitement of Control Engineering</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <h3 align="left">1.2 Motivation for Control Engineering</h3>

        <p>Feedback control has a long history which began with the early desire
        of humans to harness materials and forces of nature to their advantage.
        Early examples of control devices include clock regulating systems and
        mechanisms for keeping wind-mills pointed into the wind.</p>

        <p>A key step forward in the development of control occurred during the
        industrial revolution. At that time, machines were developed which
        greatly enhanced the capacity to turn raw materials into products of
        benefit to society. However, the associated machines, specifically steam
        engines, involved large amounts of power and it was soon realized that
        this power needed to be &quot;controlled&quot; in an organized fashion
        if the systems were to operate safely and efficiently. A major
        development at this time was Watt's fly ball governor. This device
        regulated the speed of a steam engine by throttling the flow of steam,
        see Figure 1.1. These devices remain in service to this day.</p>

        <p>The World Wars also lead to many developments in control engineering.
        Some of these were associated with guidance systems whilst others were
        connected with the enhanced manufacturing requirements necessitated by
        the war effort.</p>

        <p>The push into space in the 1960's and 70's also depended on control
        developments. These developments then flowed back into consumer goods,
        as well as commercial, environmental and medical applications. These
        applications of advanced control have continued at a rapid pace. To
        quote just one example, centre line thickness control in rolling mills
        has been a major success story for the application of advanced control
        ideas. Indeed, the accuracy of centre line thickness control has
        improved by two orders of magnitude over the past 50 years due, in part,
        to enhanced control. For many companies these developments were not only
        central to increased profitability but also to remaining in business.</p>

        <p>By the end of the twentieth century, control has become a ubiquitous
        (but largely unseen) element of modern society. Virtually every system
        we come in contact with is underpinned by sophisticated control systems.
        Examples range from simple household products (temperature regulation in
        air-conditioners, thermostats in hot water heaters etc.) to more
        sophisticated systems such as the family car (which has hundreds of
        control loops) to large scale systems (such as chemical plants,
        aircraft, and manufacturing processes).</p>

        <p>Many of these industrial controllers involve &quot;cutting edge&quot;
        technologies. For example, in the rolling mill example quoted earlier,
        the control system involves forces of the order of 2,000 tonnes, speeds
        up to 120 km/hour and tolerances (in the aluminum industry) of 5
        micrometers or 1/500th of the thickness of a human hair! All of this is
        achieved with precision hardware, advanced computational tools and
        sophisticated control algorithms.</p>

        <p>Beyond these &quot;industrial&quot; examples, feedback regulatory
        mechanisms are central to the operation of biological systems,
        communication networks, national economies, and even human interactions.
        Indeed if one thinks carefully, control in one form or another, can be
        found in every aspect of life.</p>

        <p>In this context, control engineering is concerned with designing,
        implementing and maintaining these systems. As we shall see later, this
        is one of the most challenging and interesting areas of modern
        engineering. Indeed, to carry out control successfully one needs to
        combine many disciplines including modeling (to capture the underlying
        physics and chemistry of the process), sensor technology (to measure the
        status of the system), actuators (to apply corrective action to the
        system), communications (to transmit data), computing (to perform the
        complex task of changing measured data into appropriate actuator
        actions), and interfacing (to allow the multitude of different
        components in a control system to &quot;talk&quot; to each other in a
        seamless fashion).</p>

        <p>Thus control engineering is an exciting multidisciplinary subject
        with an enormously large range of practical applications. Moreover,
        interest in control is unlikely to diminish in the foreseeable future.
        On the contrary, it is likely to become ever more important due to the
        increasing globalization of markets and environmental concerns.</p>
