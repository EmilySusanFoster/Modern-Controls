        <h2 align="center">24. Fundamental Design Limitations in MIMO Control</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>The best way to learn about real design issues is to become involved
        in practical applications. Hopefully, the reader may have gained some
        feeling for the lateral thinking that is typically needed in all real
        world problems from reading the various case studies that we have
        presented. In particular, we point to the 5 MIMO case studies described
        in Chapter 22.</p>

        <p>In this chapter, we will adopt a more abstract stance and extend the
        design insights of Chapters 8 and 9 to the MIMO case. As a prelude to
        this, we recall that in Chapter 17 we saw that by a combination of an
        observer and state estimate feedback, the closed loop poles of a MIMO
        system can be exactly (or approximately) assigned depending on the
        synthesis method used. However, as in the SISO case, this leaves open
        two key questions; namely, where should the poles be placed and what are
        the associated sensitivity trade-off issues. This raises fundamental
        design issues which are the MIMO versions of the topics discussed in
        Chapters 8 and 9.</p>

        <p>It has been shown in Chapters 8 and 9 that the open loop properties
        of a SISO plant impose fundamental and unavoidable constraints on the
        closed loop characteristics that are achievable. For example, we have
        seen that, for a one degree of freedom loop, a double integrator in the
        open loop transfer function implies that the integral of the error due
        to a step reference change must be zero. We have also seen that real RHP
        zeros necessarily imply undershoot in the response to a step reference
        change.</p>

        <p>As might be expected, similar concepts apply to multivariable
        systems. However, whereas in SISO systems, one has only the frequency
        (or time) axis along which to deal with the constraints, in MIMO systems
        there is also a spatial dimension, i.e. one can trade off limitations
        between different outputs as well as on a frequency by frequency basis.
        This means that it is necessary to also account for the interactions
        between outputs rather than simply being able to focus on one output at
        a time. These issues will be explored below.</p>

          <li>Analogous to the SISO case, MIMO performance specifications can
            generally not be addressed independently from another, since they
            are linked by a web of trade-offs.<br>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There also exist frequency- and time-domain trade-offs due to
            unstable poles and zeros:
            <ul>
              <li><em>qualitatively</em> they parallel the SISO results in that
                (in a MIMO measure) low bandwidth in conjunction with unstable
                poles is associated with increasing overshoot, whereas high
                bandwidth in conjunction with unstable zeros is associated with
                increasing undershoot</li>
              <li><em>quantitatively</em>, the measure in which the above is
                true is more complex than in the SISO case: the effects of
                under- and overshoot, as well as integral constraints, pertain
                to linear combinations of the MIMO channels.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>MIMO systems are subject to the additional design specification of
            desired decoupling.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Decoupling is related to the time- and frequency-domain
            constraints via directionality:
            <ul>
              <li>The constraints due to open-loop NMP zeros with non-canonical
                directions can be isolated in a subset of outputs, if triangular
                decoupling is acceptable.</li>
              <li>Alternatively, if dynamic decoupling is enforced, the
                constraint is dispersed over several channels.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Advantages and disadvantages of completely decentralized control,
            dynamical and triangular decoupling designs were illustrated with an
            industrial case study:</li>
