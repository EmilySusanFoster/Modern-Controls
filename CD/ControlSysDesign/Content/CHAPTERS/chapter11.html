        <h2 align="center">11. Dealing with Constraints</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>An ubiquitous problem in control is that all real actuators have
        limited authority. This implies that they are constrained in amplitude
        and/or rate of change. If one ignores this possibility then serious
        degradation in performance can result in the event that the input
        reaches a constraint limit. This is clearly a very important problem.
        There are two ways of dealing with it:</p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>reduce the performance demands so that a linear controller never
            violates the limits, or</li>
          <li>modify the design to account for the limits</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Option (i) above is the most common strategy. However, this implies
        that either the actuator was oversized in the first place or one is
        unnecessarily compromising the performance. Anyway, we will see below
        that option (ii) is quite easy to achieve.</p>

        <p>This chapter gives a first treatment of option (ii) based on
        modifying a given linear design. This will usually work satisfactorily
        for modest violations of the constraint (up to say 100%). If more
        serious violations of the constraints occur then we would argue that the
        actuator has been undersized for the given application.</p>

        <p>We will also show how the same ideas can be used to avoid simple
        kinds of state constraint.</p>

        <p>Here we assume that the control laws are bi-proper and minimum phase.
        This will generally be true in SISO systems. Bi-properness can be
        achieved by adding extra zeros if necessary. Techniques that do not
        depend on those assumptions will be described in section 18.? of Chapter
        18.</p>

        <p>Also, in a later chapter (Chapter 25) we will describe another
        technique for dealing with control and state constraints based on
        constraint optimal control theory. These latter techniques are generally
        called &quot;model predictive control&quot;, and one of the major
        success stories in modern control.</p>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Constraints are ubiquitous in real control systems<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>There are two possible strategies for dealing with them
            <ul>
              <li>limit the performance so that the constraints are never
                violated</li>
              <li>carry out a design with the constraints in mind<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Here we have given a brief introduction to the latter idea<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>A very useful insight is provided by the arrangement shown in
            Figure 19.19, which can be set in a general inversion set-up:</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li><i>X</i> is a bi-proper, stable, minimum-phase transfer function</li>
            <li><img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part3-img26.gif" alt="$x_\infty $" width="26" height="28">
              is the high-frequency gain of <img align="middle" border="0" src="part3-img31.gif" alt="$x_\infty \neq 0$" width="164" height="20"></li>
            <li>given that <i>X</i> is bi-proper, then <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part3-img32.gif" alt="$%
x_\infty ^{-1}$" width="54" height="18"> and hence 
                <!-- MATH: $%
x_\infty ^{-1}$ --><img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part3-img33.gif" alt="$%
x_\infty ^{-1}$" width="27" height="21"> is finite</li>
            <li>the overall system is equivalent to <i>X</i><sup>-1</sup></li>
            <li>the fascinating and useful point about the implementation in
              Figure 11.14 is that the circuit effectively inverts <i>X</i>
              without that <i>X</i> was inverted explicitly<br>
              &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Here we have used this idea to describe ant-windup mechanisms for
            achieving input saturation and slew rate limits<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>We have also shown how state constraints might be achieved<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>In later chapters we will use the same idea for many other
            purposes</li>
