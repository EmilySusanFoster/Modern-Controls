        <h2 align="center">16. Control Design Based on Optimisation</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>
        Thus far we have seen that design constraints arise from a number of
        different sources
        <ul>
          <li>structural plant properties, such as NMP zeros or unstable poles
          <li>disturbances, their frequency content, point of injection and
            measurability
          <li>architectural properties and the resulting algebraic laws of
            trade-off
          <li>integral constraints and the resulting integral laws of trade-off
        </ul>

        <p>The subtlety as well as complexity of the emergent trade-off web into
        which the designer needs to ease a solution, motivates interest in what
        is known as <em>criterion based</em> control design or <em>optimal</em>
        control theory: the aim here is to capture the control objective in a
        mathematical criterion and solve it for the controller that (depending
        on the formulation) maximizes or minimizes it.</p>

        <p>Three questions arise:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Is optimization of the criterion mathematically feasible?</li>
          <li>How good is the resulting controller?</li>
          <li>Can the constraint of the trade-off web be circumvented by
            optimization?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Question (1) has an affirmative answer for a number of criterion. In
        particular, quadratic formulations tend to favor tractability. Also, the
        affine parameterization of Chapter 15 is a key enabler, since it renders
        the sensitivity functions affine in the sought variable, <i>Q</i>.</p>

        <p>The answer to question (2) has two facets: how good is the controller
        as measured by the criterion? Answer: it is optimal by construction; but
        how good is the resulting control loop performance as measured by the
        original performance specifications? Answer: as good, or as poor, as the
        criterion in use can capture the design intention and active trade-offs.
        A poorly formulated criterion will simply yield a controller which <em>optimally</em>
        implements the poor design. However when selected well, a design
        criterion can synthesize a controller which would have been difficult to
        conceive of by the techniques covered thus far; this is particularly
        true for multivariable systems covered in the next part of the book.</p>

        <p>Question (3) is simply answered by <em>no</em>: all linear time
        invariant controllers, whether they were synthesized by trial and error,
        pole assignment or optimization, are subject to the same fundamental
        trade-off laws.</p>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimization can often be used to assist with certain aspects of
            control system design.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The answer provided by an optimization strategy is only as good as
            the question that has been asked.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Optimization needs to be carefully employed keeping in mind the
            complex web of trade-offs involved in all control system design.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Quadratic optimization is a particularly simple strategy and leads
            to a closed form solution.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Quadratic optimization can be used for optimal Q synthesis.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>We have also shown that quadratic optimization can be effectively
            used to formulate and solve robust control problems when the model
            uncertainty is specified in the form of a frequency domain
            probabilistic error.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Within this framework we have shown that the robust controller <i>biases</i>
            the nominal solution arising from optimal nominal design so as to
            create a gap for model uncertainty whilst attempting to minimize
            affecting the achieved performance.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>This can be viewed as a formal way of achieving the bandwidth
            reduction which was discussed earlier as a mechanism for providing a
            robustness <em>gap</em> in control system design.</li>
