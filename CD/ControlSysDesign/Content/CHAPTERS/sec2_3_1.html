        <h3 align="left">2.3.1 Performance specifications</h3>

        <p>There are two fundamental specifications for the continuous caster:
        safety and profitability.

        <p>These ultimate requirements can be further broken down to derive a
        control system specification that quantifies the target to be met by
        controller-design (Figure 2.3):</p>

        Figure 2.3:</strong> Deriving control system specifications from
        fundamental performance requirements</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Safety</i>: In this example, the safety requirement translates
            rather straight-forwardly into a constraint on the level of molten
            steel in the mould (called the <i>mould level</i>). Clearly, the
            mould level must never be in danger of overflowing or emptying as
            either case would result in molten metal spilling with disastrous
            consequences.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li><i>Profitability</i>: Obviously the system needs to be operated in
            a cost effective fashion. Aspects which contribute to this
            requirement include:<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Product quality</i>: It turns out that high frequency changes
              in the mould level reduce bloom quality, as molten metal has a
              viscosity similar to water and turbulence mixes impurities into
              the steel. Furthermore, due to the cooling applied to the mould,
              an oscillating mould level results in uneven cooling of the steel
              which also reduces its quality. Thus, product quality demands
              steady control of the mould level.<br>
              &nbsp;</li>
            <li><i>Maintenance</i>: Due to an oxidizing reaction, the nozzle
              through which the metal flows into the mould is subject to intense
              wear at the mould level. The nozzle's lifetime is therefore
              maximized if the mould level is controlled so that it slowly ramps
              across the wear band of the nozzle. Maintenance costs are further
              reduced if the lifetime of the control valve is maximized by
              having relatively non-aggressive control actions. Thus, keeping
              the cost of maintenance low requires steady regulation around a
              set-point that slowly ramps across the nozzle wear band while
              avoiding aggressive valve movements.<br>
              &nbsp;</li>
            <li><i>Throughput</i>: Throughput is a direct function of casting
              speed. The casting speed, however, is also a function of numerous
              process up-stream factors (availability of the necessary grades of
              raw material, furnace capacity, etc.) as well as down-stream
              factors (product demand, shipping capacity, etc.). Thus, the mould
              level control system should maintain performance at all casting
              speeds to avoid being a limiting factor in the overall operation
              of the process.</li>
          </ul>
