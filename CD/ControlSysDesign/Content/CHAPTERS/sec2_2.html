        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <h3 align="left">2.2 The Principle Goal of Control</h3>

        <p>As we have seen in Chapter 1, examples of dynamic systems with
        automatic controllers abound: advanced process controllers are operating
        in virtually every industrial domain; micro-controllers pervade an
        immense array of household and entertainment electronics; thermostats
        regulate temperatures in domestic- to industrial-sized ovens and
        autopilots control aircraft.</p>

        <p>Designing any one of these systems requires the close cooperation of
        experts from various disciplines.</p>

        <p>To particularize the principal goal of control engineering within
        this team effort, it is helpful to distinguish between a system's
        tangible realization and its behavior. The aircraft's physical
        realization, for example, includes fuselage, wings and ailerons. Its
        behavior, on the other hand, refers to the aircraft's dynamic response
        to a change in throttle-, aileron- or flap-position.</p>

        <p>To control such a system automatically, one needs to interface the
        system to a controller, which will also have a physical realization and
        behavior. Depending on the application, the controller could be realized
        in a chip, analogue electronics, a PLC or a computer. There also needs
        to be a channel by which the controller and system can interact via
        sensors and actuators: sensors to report the state of the system,
        actuators as a means for the controller to act on the system.</p>

        <p>With this process and control infrastructure in place, the key
        remaining question pertains to the controller behavior. In the aircraft
        application, for example, if the controller (here called an autopilot)
        detects a deviation in speed, height or heading via the sensors, just
        how should it command throttle and ailerons to get back on target?</p>

        <p>This is the control engineer's key concern, or stated in general
        terms, the fundamental goal of control engineering is to find
        technically, environmentally and economically feasible ways of acting on
        systems to control their outputs to desired values, thus ensuring a
        desired level of performance. Of course, finding a good solution to this
        question frequently requires an involvement in process design, actuator
        and sensor selection, mathematical analysis and modeling.</p>

        <p>The control engineer's perspective of the aircraft navigation example
        described above includes a cyclical dependency: autopilot commands
        affect the aircraft, whose changed speed, height and heading, in turn,
        affect the further actions of the autopilot.</p>

        <p>Such a cyclically dependent interaction between system behaviors is
        called <b>feedback</b>.</p>

        <p>Feedback phenomena exist both in nature and technology. The periodic
        population growth and reduction in the famous predator and prey
        interactions are an example of feedback occurring in nature. The
        high-pitch whistling sound occurring as a result of interaction between
        microphones and loudspeakers in a concert hall, is a technical example
        of feedback.</p>

        <p>In both of these cases, neither of the two interacting systems can be
        clearly designated as controller or process - they are simply two
        systems interacting in feedback. Nevertheless, the feedback interaction
        is seen to have a profound impact on the behavior of the engaged
        systems.</p>

        <p>This behavior altering effect of feedback is a key mechanism that
        control engineers exploit deliberately to achieve the objective of <b>acting
        on a system to ensure that the desired performance specifications are
        achieved</b>.</p>
