        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>Up to this point in the book we have seen many different methods for
        designing controllers of different types. On reading all of this, one
        might be tempted to ask if there wasn't some easy way that one could
        specify <em>all</em> possible controllers that, at least, stabilized a
        given system. This sounds, at first glance a formidable task. However,
        we will show in this chapter that it is actually quite easy to give a
        relatively straightforward description of all stabilizing controllers
        for both open loop stable and unstable linear plants. This leads to an
        affine parameterization of all possible nominal sensitivity functions.
        This affine structure, in turn, gives valuable insights into the control
        problem and opens the door to various optimization based strategies for
        design. The main ideas presented in this chapter include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>motivation for the affine parameterization and the idea of open
            loop inversion
          <li>affine parameterization and Internal Model Control
          <li>affine parameterization and performance specifications
          <li>PID synthesis using the affine parameterization
          <li>control of time delayed plants and affine parameterization.
            Connections with the Smith controller.
          <li>interpolation to remove undesirable open loop poles
        </ul>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The previous part of the book established that closed loop
            properties are interlocked in a network of trade offs. Hence, tuning
            for one property automatically impacts on other properties. This
            necessitates an understanding of the interrelations and conscious
            trade-off decisions.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The fundamental laws of trade-off presented in previous chapters
            allow one to both identify unachievable specifications as well as to
            establish where further effort is warranted or wasted.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>However, when pushing a design maximally towards a subtle
            trade-off, the earlier formulation of the fundamental laws falls
            short because it is difficult to push the performance of a design by
            tuning in terms of controller numerator and denominator: The impact
            on the trade-off determining sensitivity-poles and zeros is very
            nonlinear, complex and subtle.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>This shortcoming raises the need for an alternative controller
            representation that
            <ul>
              <li>allows one to design more explicitly in terms of the
                quantities of interest (the sensitivities),</li>
              <li>makes stability explicit, and</li>
              <li>makes the impact of the controller on the trade-offs explicit.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>This need is met by the affine parameterization, also known as <i>Youla
            parameterization<br>

          <li>Observe the following advantages of the affine parameterization:
            <ul>
              <li>nominal stability is explicit</li>
              <li>the known quantity <i>G</i><sub><i>o</i></sub> and the
                quantity sought by the control engineer (<i>Q</i>) occur in the
                highly insightful relation <i>T</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>= <i>QG</i><sub><i>o</i></sub>
                (multiplicative in the frequency domain); whether a designer
                chooses to work in this quantity from the beginning or prefers
                to start with a synthesis technique and then convert, the simple
                multiplicative relation <i>QG</i><sub><i>o</i></sub> provides
                deep insights into the trade-offs of a particular problem and
                provides a very direct means of pushing the design by shaping <i>Q</i></li>
              <li>the sensitivities are affine in <i>Q</i>, which is a great
                advantage for synthesis techniques relying on numerical
                minimization of a criterion (see Chapter 16 for a detailed
                discussion of <em>optimization</em> methods which exploit this
                parameterization)<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The following points are important to avoid some common
            misconceptions:
            <ul>
              <li>the associated trade-offs are not a consequence of the affine
                parameterization: they are perfectly general and hold for any
                linear time invariant controller including LQR, PID, pole
                placement based, <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part5-img6.gif" alt="$H_\infty $" width="30" height="29">,
                etc.
              <li>we have used the affine parameterization to make the general
                trade-offs more visible and to provide a direct means for the
                control engineer to make trade-off decisions; this should not be
                confused with synthesis techniques that make particular choices
                in the affine parameterization to synthesize a controller
              <li>the fact that <i>Q</i> must approximate the inverse of the
                model at frequencies where the sensitivity is meant to be small
                is perfectly general and highlights the fundamental importance
                of inversion in control. This does <i>not</i> necessarily mean
                that the <i>controller</i>, <i>C</i>, must contain this
                approximate inverse as a factor and should not be confused with
                the pros and cons of that particular design choice<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>PI and PID design based on affine parameterization.
            <ul>
              <li>PI and PID controllers are traditionally tuned in terms of
                their parameters.</li>
              <li>However, systematic design, trade-off decisions and deciding
                whether a PI(D) is sufficient or not, is significantly easier in
                the model-based affine structure.</li>
              <li>Inserting a first order model into the affine structure
                automatically generates a PI controller.</li>
              <li>Inserting a second order model into the <i>Q</i>-structure
                automatically generates a PID controller.</li>
              <li>All trade-offs and insights of the previous chapters also
                apply to PID based control loops.</li>
              <li>Whether a PI(D) is sufficient for a particular process is
                directly related to whether or not a first (second) order model
                can approximate the process well up to the frequencies where
                performance is limited by other factors such as delays, actuator
                saturations, sensor noise or fundamentally unknown dynamics.</li>
              <li>The first and second order models are easily obtained from
                step response models (Chapter 3).</li>
              <li>The chapter provides explicit formulas for first-order,
                time-delay, second order and integrating processes.</li>
              <li>Using this method, the control engineer works directly in
                terms of observable process properties (rise time, gain, etc)
                and closed loop parameters providing an insightful basis for
                making trade-off decisions. The PI(D) parameters follow
                automatically.</li>
              <li>Since the PI(D) parameter formulas are provided explicitly in
                terms of physical process parameters, the PI(D) gains can be
                scheduled to measurably changing parameters without extra effort
                (it is possible, for example, to schedule for a speed-dependent
                time-delay).</li>
              <li>The approach does not preempt the design choice of canceling
                or shifting the open-loop poles - both are possible and
                associated with different trade-offs.<br>

          <li>Summary of results for systems having time-delays:
            <ul>
              <li>The key issue is that delays cannot be inverted.</li>
              <li>In that sense, delays are related to NMP plant zeros, which
                cannot be stably inverted either.</li>
              <li>A delay of magnitude <i>T</i>, causes similar trade-offs as an
                unstable zero at <i>s</i>=<i>T</i>/2.</li>
              <li>An early controller conceived to deal with the non-invertibility
                of delays is the famous Smith-predictor.</li>
              <li>The trade-offs made in the Smith-predictor can be nicely
                analyzed in the affine structure. Indeed, the structures are
                very similar. Caution should be exercised, however, not to
                confuse the generic controller representation of the affine
                parameterization with the particular synthesis technique of the
                Smith-predictor.<br>
