        <p>Chapter 8 showed, via elementary time domain arguments based on the
        Laplace transform, that fundamental limitations exist on the achievable
        performance of linear control systems. For example, it was shown that
        real right half plane open loop plant zeros always lead to undershoot in
        the reference to output step response. Moreover, the extent of this
        undershoot increases as the response time of the closed loop system
        decreases. This implies that right half plane plant zeros place an
        inescapable upper limit on the achievable closed loop bandwidth if
        excessive undershoot is to be avoided. Similarly, it was shown that real
        right half plane open loop plant poles always lead to overshoot in one
        degree of freedom feedback systems. The purpose of the current chapter
        is to develop equivalent frequency domain constraints and to explore
        their interpretations.</p>

        <p>The results to be presented here have a long and rich history
        beginning with the seminal work of Bode published in his 1945 book on
        network synthesis. Since that time the results have been embellished in
        many ways. In this chapter we summarize the single input single output
        results. In Chapter 24 we will extend the results to the multivariable
        case.</p>

        <p>All of the results follow from the assumption that the sensitivity
        functions are analytic in the closed right half plane (i.e. that they
        are required to be stable). Analytic function theory then implies that
        the sensitivity functions cannot be arbitrarily specified but, indeed,
        must satisfy certain precise integral constraints.</p>

        <p>The necessary background to appreciate these results is elementary
        analytic function theory. Since this theory may not have been met by all
        readers previously we present a brief review in Appendix C. The current
        chapter can be read in one of two ways. Either, the background
        mathematics can be taken for granted, in which case the emphasis will be
        on the interpretation of the results. Alternatively, and preferably, the
        reader can gain a full appreciation by first reviewing the results given
        in Appendix C. The key result is the Cauchy Integral Formula and its
        immediate consequences - the Poisson Jensen Formula.</p>

        <p>Most of the results to be discussed below are based on cumulative
        (i.e. integral or summation) measures of 
        <!-- MATH: $\ln \left| S_o(j\omega
)\right|$ -->

        functions of sensitivity magnitudes have a sign change when these

          <li>One class of design constraints are those which hold at a
            particular frequency.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Thus we can view the law 
            <!-- MATH: $S(j\omega)=1-T(j\omega)$ -->

            on a frequency by frequency basis. It states that no single
            frequency can be removed from both the sensitivity,

            <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part3-img15.gif" alt="$S(j\omega)$" width="44" height="31">,
            and complementary sensitivity, 
            <!-- MATH: $T(j\omega)$ -->

            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>There is, however, an additional class of design considerations,
            which results from so called frequency domain integral constraints.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>This chapter explores the origin and nature of these integral
            constraints and derives their implications for control system
            performance:
            <ul>
              <li>the constraints are a direct consequence of the requirement
                that all sensitivity functions must be stable</li>
              <li>mathematically, this means that the sensitivities are required
                to be analytic in the right half complex plane</li>
              <li>results from analytic function theory then show, that this
                requirement necessarily implies weighted integrals of the
                frequency response necessarily evaluate to a constant</li>
              <li>hence, if one designs a controller to have low sensitivity in
                a particular frequency range, then the sensitivity will
                necessarily increase at other frequencies-a consequence of the
                weighted integral always being a constant; this phenomenon has
                also been called the <em>water bed effect</em> (pushing down on
                the water bed in one area, raises it somewhere else).</li>
