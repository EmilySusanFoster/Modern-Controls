        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <h3 align="left">1.4 Types of Control System Design</h3>

        <p>Control system design in practice requires cyclic effort in which one
        iterates between modeling design, simulation, testing and
        implementation.</p>

        <p>Control system design also takes several different forms and each
        requires a slightly different approach.</p>

        <p>One factor that impacts on the form is whether the system is part of
        a predominantly commercial mission or not. Examples where this is not
        the case include research, education and missions such as landing the
        first man on the moon. Although cost is always a consideration, these
        types of control design are mainly dictated by technical, pedagogical,
        reliability and safety concerns.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if the control design is motivated commercially,
        one again gets different situations depending on whether the controller
        is part of a larger commercial product (such as the cruise controller or
        ABS in a car) or whether it is part of a manufacturing process (such as
        the motion controller in the robots assembling a car). In the first case
        one must also consider the cost of including the controller in every
        product, which usually means that there is a major premium on cost and
        hence one is forced to use rather simple microcontrollers. In the second
        case one can usually afford significantly more complex controllers,
        provided they improve the manufacturing process in a way that
        significantly enhances the value of the manufactured product.</p>

        <p>In all of these situations, the control engineer is further affected
        by where the control system is in its lifecycle, e.g.:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Initial &quot;grass roots&quot; design
          <li>Commissioning and Tuning
          <li>Refinement and Upgrades
          <li>Forensic studies</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.4.1 Initial &quot;grass roots&quot; design</h4>

        <p>In this phase, the control engineer is faced by a
        ``green-field&quot;, or so called ``grass roots&quot; projects and thus
        the designer can steer the development of a system from the beginning.
        This includes ensuring that the design of the overall system takes
        account of the subsequent control issues. All too often, systems and
        plants are designed based on steady state considerations alone. It is
        then small wonder that operational difficulties can appear down the
        track. It is our belief that control engineers should be an integral
        part of all design teams. The control engineer needs to interact with
        the design specifications and to ensure that dynamic as well as
        steady-state issues are considered.</p>
        <h4>1.4.2 Commissioning and tuning</h4>

        <p>Once the basic architecture of a control system is in place, then the
        control engineer's job becomes one of tuning the control system to meet
        the required performance specifications as closely as possible. This
        phase requires a deep understanding of feedback principles to ensure
        that the tuning of the control system is carried out in an expedient,
        safe and satisfactory fashion.</p>
        <h4>1.4.3 Refinement and upgrades</h4>

        <p>Once a system is up and running, then the control engineer's job
        turns into one of maintenance and refinement. The motivation for
        refinement can come from many directions. They include
        <ul>
          <li>internal forces - e.g. the availability of new sensors or
            actuators may open the door for improved performance
          <li>external forces - e.g. market pressures, or new environmental
            legislation may necessitate improved control performance</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.4.4 &quot;Forensic&quot; studies</h4>

        <p>&quot;Forensic&quot; investigations are often the role of control
        engineering consultants. Here the aim is to suggest remedial actions
        that will rectify an observed control problem. In these studies, it is
        important that the control engineer take a holistic view since
        successful control performance usually depends on satisfactory operation
        of many interconnected components. In our experience, poor control
        performance is as likely to be associated with basic plant design flaws,
        poor actuators, inadequate sensors, or computer problems as it is to be
        the result of poor control law tuning. However, all of these issues can,
        and should be, part of the control engineer's domain. Indeed, it is
        often only the control engineer who has the necessary overview to
        successfully resolve these complex issues.</p>
