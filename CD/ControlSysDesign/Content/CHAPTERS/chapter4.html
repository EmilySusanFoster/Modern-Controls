        <p>The advantage of being able to cast a modeling problem into the form
        of a linear approximation is that subsequent analysis, as well as
        controller design, can draw on the wealth of information that is
        available about the operation of linear systems. In this chapter we will
        cover the fundamentals of this theory for linear models of
        continuous-time processes. Specific topics to be covered include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>linear high order differential equation models</li>
          <li>Laplace transforms, which convert linear differential equations to
            algebraic equations, thus greatly simplifying their study</li>
          <li>methods for assessing the stability of linear dynamic systems</li>
          <li>frequency response.</li>
        </ul>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Ultimately, all physical systems exhibit some form of nonlinearity.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Nevertheless, there is a strong incentive to find a model that is
            <ul>
              <li>linear</li>
              <li>yet sufficiently accurate for the purpose</li>
            </ul>
            Incentives include the following properties of linear models:
            <ul>
              <li>theory and techniques are significantly simpler and more
                tractable</li>
              <li>there are more closed form solutions as well as easier-to use
                software tools</li>
              <li>superposition holds; for example, the response to
                simultaneously acting setpoint changes and disturbances is equal
                to the sum of these signals acting individually</li>
              <li>a powerful body of frequency domain properties and results
                holds: poles, zeros, transfer functions, Bode and Nyquist plots
                with their associated properties and results</li>
              <li>relative degree, inversion, stability and inverse stability
                are easier to define and check<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Means to approximate physical systems by linear models include
            <ul>
              <li><em>transformations</em>, such as change of variable</li>
              <li><em>approximations</em>, such as Taylor series in a
                neighborhood, black-box identification, etc.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          <li>These points motivate the basic presumption of linearity used in
            the next few chapters; later chapters introduce techniques for
            systems which are inherently nonlinear.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>There are two key approaches to linear dynamic models:
            <ul>
              <li>the, so-called, time domain, and</li>
              <li>the, so-called, frequency domain.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Although these two approaches are largely equivalent, they each
            have their own particular advantages and it is therefore important
            to have a good grasp of each.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>In the time domain,
            <ul>
              <li>systems are modeled by differential equations</li>
              <li>systems are characterized by the evolution of their variables
                (output etc) in time</li>
              <li>the evolution of variables in time is computed by solving
                differential equations<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Stable time responses are typically characterized in terms of:</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The importance of these models is due to
          <ul>
            <li>them being frequently observed in practice</li>
            <li>more complex systems being decomposable into them by partial

        <li>Evaluating a transfer function at any one frequency yields a

          continuous time system is

        <li>The response of linear systems to an arbitrary driving input can be
          decomposed into the sum of two components:
          <ul>
            <li>the natural response, which is a function of initial conditions,
              but independent of the driving input; if the system is stable, the
              natural response decays to zero</li>
            <li>the forced response, which is a function of the driving input,
              but independent of initial conditions<br>

        <li>Equivalent ways of viewing transfer function models include
          <ul>
            <li>the Laplace transform of a system's differential equation model</li>
            <li>the Laplace transform of the system’s forced response to an
              impulse</li>
            <li>a model derived directly from experimental observation<br>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In principle, the time response of a transfer function can be
          obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform of the output;
          however, in practice one almost always prefers to transform the
          transfer function to the time domain and to solve the differential
          equations numerically.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Key strengths of time domain models include:
          <ul>
            <li>they are particularly suitable for solution and simulation on a
              digital computer</li>
            <li>they are extendible to more general classes of models, such as
              nonlinear systems</li>
            <li>they play a fundamental role in state space theory, covered in
              later chapters<br>
              &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Key strengths of frequency domain models (transfer functions)
          include:
          <ul>
            <li>they can be manipulated by simple algebraic rules; thus,
              transfer functions of parallel, series or feedback architectures
              can be simply computed</li>
            <li>properties such as inversion, stability, inverse stability and
              even a qualitative understanding of transients are easily inferred
              from knowledge of the poles and zeros<br>
              &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Time-domain and frequency domain models can be converted from one to
          the other.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>All models contain modeling errors.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Modeling errors can be described as an additive (AME) or
          multiplicative (MME) quantity.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Modeling errors are necessarily unknown and frequently described by
          upper bounds.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Certain types of commonly occurring modeling errors, such as
          numerical inaccuracy, missing poles, inaccurate resonant peaks or time
          delays, have certain <em>finger prints</em>.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>One can generally assume that modeling errors increase with
          frequency, the MME typically possessing a high-pass character.</li>
