        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>Models for discrete time systems have been described in Chapter 1.
        There we saw that digital and continuous systems were actually quite
        close. Hence it is often true that digital responses approach the
        corresponding continuous response as the sampling period goes to zero.
        For this reason, in the remainder of the book we will present continuous
        and discrete ideas in parallel. The purpose of the current chapter is to
        provide a smooth transition to this latter work by highlighting the
        special issues associated with digital control. In particular, the
        chapter covers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>why one cannot simply treat digital control as if it were exactly
            the same as continuous control, and
          <li>how to carry out designs for digital control systems so that the <em>at-sample</em>
            response is exactly treated.
        </ul>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>There are a number of ways of designing digital control systems:
            <ul>
              <li>design in continuous time and discretize the controller prior
                to implementation;</li>
              <li>model the process by a digital model and carry out the design
                in discrete time;<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Continuous time design which is discretized for implementation;
            <ul>
              <li>Continuous time signals and models are utilized for the
                design.</li>
              <li>Prior to implementation, the controller is replaced by an
                equivalent discrete time version.</li>
              <li><em>Equivalent</em> means that simply maps <i>s</i> to <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">
                (where <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part4-img7.gif" alt="$\delta $" width="11" height="15">
                is the delta operator).</li>
              <li>Caution must be exercised since the analysis was carried out
                in continuous time and the expected results are therefore based
                on the assumption that the sampling rate is high enough to mask
                sampling effects.</li>
              <li>If the sampling period is chosen carefully, in particular with
                respect to the open and closed loop dynamics, then the results
                should be acceptable.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Discrete design based on a discretized process model:
            <ul>
              <li>First the model of the continuous process is discretized.</li>
              <li>Then, based on the discrete process, a discrete controller is
                designed and implemented.</li>
              <li>Caution must be exercised with so called intersample behavior:
                the analysis is based entirely on the behavior as observed at
                discrete points in time, but the process has a continuous
                behavior also between sampling instances.</li>
              <li>Problems can be avoided by refraining from designing solutions
                which appear feasible in a discrete time analysis, but are known
                to be unachievable in a continuous time analysis (such as
                removing non-minimum phase zeros from the closed loop!).<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The following rules of thumb will help avoid intersample problems
            if a purely digital design is carried out:
            <ul>
              <li>Sample 10 times the desired closed loop bandwidth.</li>
              <li>Use simple anti-aliasing filters to avoid excessive phase
                shift.</li>
              <li>Never try to cancel or otherwise compensate for discrete
                sampling zeros.</li>
              <li>Always check the intersample response.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
