        <h2 align="center">Introduction to the Principles of Feedback Control</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <h3 align="left">2.9 Measurements</h3>

        <p>We have seen that one of the key issues in feedback control is that
        there must exist suitable measurements to feed back. Indeed, if one can
        measure a variable, then there is a good chance that one can design a
        controller to bring it to a desired reference value.</p>

        <p>A more accurate description of the feedback control loop including
        sensors is shown in <a href="#fig:inv4">Figure 2.12</a>. From this
        figure, it can be seen that what we actually control is the measured
        value rather than the true output. These can be quite different.</p>

        </a><strong>Figure 2.12:</strong> Closed loop control with sensors</p>

        <p>Hence the measurement system should ideally satisfy requirements such
        as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Reliability</em>. It should operate within the necessary
            range.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li><em>Accuracy</em>. For a variable with a constant value, the
            measurement should settle to the correct value.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li><em>Responsiveness</em>. If the variable changes, the measurement
            should be able to follow the changes. Slow responding measurements
            can, not only affect the quality of control but can actually make
            the feedback loop unstable. Loop instability may arise even though
            the loop has been designed to be stable assuming an exact
            measurement of the process variable.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li><em>Noise<a name="339">&nbsp;</a> immunity</em>. The measurement
            system, including the transmission path, should not be significantly
            affected by exogenous signals such as measurement noise.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li><em>Linearity</em>. If the measurement system is not linear, then
            at least the nonlinearity should be known so that it can be
            compensated.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li><em>Non intrusive</em>. The measuring device should not
            significantly affect the behavior of the plant.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In most of the sequel we will assume that the measurement system is
        sufficiently good, so that only measurement noise needs to be accounted
        for. This ideal measurement loop will be known as a unity feedback loop.</p>
