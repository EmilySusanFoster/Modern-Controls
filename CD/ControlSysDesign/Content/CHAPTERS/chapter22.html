        <h2 align="center">22. Exploiting SISO Techniques in MIMO Control</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>The previous chapter gave an introduction to MIMO control system
        synthesis by showing how SISO methods could sometimes be used in MIMO
        problems. However, some MIMO problems require a fundamentally MIMO
        approach. This is the topic of the current chapter. We will emphasize
        methods based on optimal control theory. There are three reasons for
        this choice:</p>
        <dl compact>
          <dt>1
          <dd>It is relatively easy to understand.
          <dt>2
          <dd>It has been used in a myriad of applications (Indeed, the authors
            have used these methods on approximately 20 industrial
            applications).
          <dt>3
          <dd>It is a valuable precursor to other advanced methods - e.g. model
            predictive control which is explained in the next chapter.
        </dl>

        <p>The analysis presented in this chapter builds on the results in
        Chapter 18 where state space design methods were briefly described in
        the SISO context. We recall from that chapter, that the two key elements
        were</p>
        <ul>
          <li>state estimation by an observer
          <li>state estimate feedback
        </ul>

        <p>We will mirror these elements here for the MIMO case.</p>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Full multivariable control incorporates the interaction dynamics
            rigorously and explicitly.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The fundamental SISO synthesis result that, under mild conditions,
            the nominal closed loop poles can be assigned arbitrarily carries
            over to the MIMO case.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Equivalence of state feedback and frequency domain pole placement
            by solving the (multivariable) Diophantine Equation carries over as
            well.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Due to the complexities of multivariable systems, criterion based
            synthesis (briefly alluded to in the SISO case) gains additional
            motivation; it is also a powerful way to pre-compensate a system
            which is subsequently trimmed with a MIMO Q-parametrization.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>A popular family of criteria are functionals involving quadratic
            forms of control error and control effort.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>For a general nonlinear formulation, the optimal solution is
            characterized by a two-point boundary value problem.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>In the linear case (the so-called linear quadratic regulator, LQR),
            the general problem reduces to the solution of the continuous time
            dynamic Riccati equation which can be feasibly solved, leading to
            time-variable state feedback.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>After initial conditions decay, the optimal time-varying solution
            converges to a constant state feedback, the so-called steady state
            LQR solution.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>It is frequently sufficient to neglect the initial transient of
            the strict LQR and only implement the steady state LQR.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The steady state LQR is equivalent to either
            <ul>
              <li>a model matching approach, where a desired complementary
                sensitivity is specified and a controller is computed that
                matches it as closely as possible according to some selected
                measure.</li>
              <li>pole placement, where a closed loop polynomial is specified
                and a controller is computed to achieve it.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Thus, LQR, model-matching and pole-placement are mathematically
            equivalent, although they do offer different tuning parameters.<br>

          <li>These techniques can be extended to discrete time systems.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>There is a very close connection to the ‘dual’ problem of
            filtering, i.e., the problem of inferring a state from a related
            (but not exactly invertible) set of measurements.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Optimal filter design based on quadratic criteria leads again to a
            Riccati equation.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The filters can be synthesized and interpreted equivalently in a

              <li>model matching</li>

            </ul>
            framework.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The arguable most famous optimal filter formulation, the Kalman
            filter, can be given a stochastic interpretation depending on taste.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The LQR does not automatically include integral action; thus,
            rejection of constant or other polynomial disturbances must be
            enforced via the internal model principle.</li>
