        <h3 align="left">2.5 Prototype solution to the control problem via
        inversion</h3>

        <p>One particularly simple, yet insightful way of thinking about control
        problems is via inversion. To describe this idea we argue as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>say that we know what effect an action at the input of a system
            produces at the output, and<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>say that we have a desired behavior for the system output, then
            one simply needs to invert the relationship between input and output
            to determine what input action is necessary to achieve the desired
            output behavior.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In spite of the apparent naivity of this argument, its embellished
        ramifications play a profound role in control system design. In
        particular, most of the real world difficulties in control relate to the
        search for a strategy that captures the intent of the above inversion
        idea, whilst respecting a myriad of other considerations such as
        insensitivity to model errors, disturbances, measurement noise, etc.</p>

        <p>To be more specific, let us assume that the required behavior is
        specified by a scalar target signal, or <b>reference</b> <i>r</i>(<i>t</i>),
        for a particular process variable <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>). Say we also have
        available a single manipulated variable, <i>u</i>(<i>t</i>). We denote <i>y</i>
        by a function of time i.e. <img border="0" src="sec15img19.gif" align="bottom" width="122" height="19">.
        We also use <img border="0" src="sec15img20.gif" align="bottom" width="35" height="17">
        to denote the operation of a nonlinear map an <i>u</i> to produce <i>y</i>.</p>

        <p>Let us also assume (for the sake of argument) that the output is
        related to the input a known functional relationship of the form:</p>
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tr valign="MIDDLE">
            <td align="CENTER" nowrap><img src="sec15img21.gif" alt="equation 2.5.1" width="66" height="18"></td>
            <td width="10" align="RIGHT">(2.5.1)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>where <i>f</i> is a transformation or mapping (possibly dynamic)
        which describes the input-output relations in the plant. (Note: We
        introduce this term here loosely and the reader can just think of it as
        describing some (input-output) relationship.) We recall a relationship
        of the type given in (2.5.1), <i>a model</i>.</p>

        <p>The control problem then requires us to find a way to generate <i>u</i>
        in such a way that <i>y</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>r</i>. In the spirit of
        inversion, a direct, although somewhat naive, approach to obtain a
        solution would thus be to set</p>
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tr valign="MIDDLE">
            <td align="CENTER" nowrap><img src="sec15img22.gif" alt="equation 1.5.2" width="96" height="18"></td>
            <td width="10" align="RIGHT">(2.5.2)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>from which we could derive a <b>control law</b>, by solving for <i>u</i>(<i>t</i>).
        This leads to</p>
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tr valign="MIDDLE">
            <td align="CENTER" nowrap>&nbsp;<img src="sec15img23.gif" alt="equation 1.5.3" width="84" height="20"></td>
            <td width="10" align="RIGHT">(2.5.3)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>This idea is shown in Figure 2.7.</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fig2_7.gif" width="518" height="160"></p>

        <p align="center"><strong>Figure 2.7:</strong> Conceptual Controller</p>

        <p>This is a conceptual solution to the problem. However a little
        thought indicates that the answer given in (2.5.1) presupposes certain
        stringent conditions. For example, inspection of equations (2.5.1) and
        (2.5.3) suggest the following requirements:</p>
        <table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="20"></td>
            <td valign="TOP"><em>R1</em></td>
            <td>The transformation <i>f</i> needs to describe the plant exactly.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="20"></td>
            <td valign="TOP"><em>R2</em></td>
            <td>The transformation <i>f</i> should be well formulated in the
              sense that a bounded output is produced when <i>u</i> is bounded -
              we then say that the transformation is <b>stable</b>.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="20"></td>
            <td valign="TOP"><em>R3</em></td>
            <td>The inverse <i>f</i><sup>-1</sup> should also be well formulated
              in the sense used in <em>R2</em>.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="20"></td>
            <td valign="TOP"><em>R4</em></td>
            <td>No external disturbances are allowed in (2.5.1).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="20"></td>
            <td valign="TOP"><em>R5</em></td>
            <td>The resulting action <i>u</i> should be realizable and not
              violate any constraint.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Of course, these are very demanding requirements. Thus, a significant
        part of Automatic Control theory deals with the issue of how to change
        the control architecture so that inversion is achieved but in a more
        robust fashion and so that the stringent requirements set out above can
        be relaxed.</p>

        <p>To illustrate the meaning of these requirements in practice, we
        briefly review a number of situations:</p>

        <p><b>Example 2.1</b> (<b>Heat Exchanger</b>) <i>Consider the problem of
        a heat exchanger in which water is to be heated by steam having a fixed
        temperature. The plant output is the water temperature at the exchanger
        output and the manipulated variable is the air pressure (3 to 15 [psig])
        driving a pneumatic valve which regulates the amount of steam feeding
        the exchanger.</i></p>

        <p><i>In the solution of the associated control problem, the following
        issues should be considered:</i></p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Pure time delays might be a significant factor, since this
            plant involves mass and energy transportation. However a pure time
            delay does not have a realizable inverse and hence </i>R3<i> will
            not be met.</i><br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li><i>It can easily happen that, for a given reference input, the
            control law (2.5.3) leads to a manipulated variable outside the 3 to
            15 [psig] range. This will lead to </i><b>saturation</b><i> in the
            plant input. Condition </i>R5<i> will then not be met.</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Example 2.2</b> (<b>Flotation in Mineral Processing</b>) <i>In
        copper processing one crucial stage is the flotation process. In this
        process the mineral pulp (water and ground mineral) is continuously fed
        to a set of agitated containers where chemicals are added to separate
        (by flotation) the particles with high copper concentration. From a
        control point of view, the goal is to determine the appropriate addition
        of chemicals and the level of agitation to achieve maximal separation.
        Characteristics of this problem are:</i></p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>The process is complex (physically distributed, time varying,
            highly nonlinear, multivariable and so on) and hence it is difficult
            to obtain an accurate model for it. Thus </i>R1<i> is hard to
            satisfy.<br>
            &nbsp;</i></li>
          <li><i>One of the most significant disturbances in this process is the
            size of the mineral particles in the pulp. This disturbance is
            actually the output of a previous stage (grinding). To apply a
            control law derived from (2.5.1) one would need to measure the sizes
            of all of these particles, or at least to obtain some average
            measure of this. Thus, condition </i>R4<i> is hard to satisfy.<br>
            &nbsp;</i></li>
          <li><i>Pure time delays are also present in this process and thus
            condition </i>R3<i> cannot be satisfied.</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>One could imagine various other practical cases where one or more of
        the requirements listed above cannot be satisfied. Thus the only
        sensible way to proceed is to accept that there will inevitably be
        intrinsic limitations and to pursue the solution within those
        limitations. With this in mind, we will impose constraints which will
        allow us to solve the problem subject to the limitations which the
        physical set-up imposes. The most commonly used constraints are:</p>
        <div align="center">
          <table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
            <tr>

              <td valign="top"><em>L1</em></td>
              <td valign="top">To <b>restrict</b> attention to those problems
                where the prescribed behavior (reference signals) belong to
                restricted classes and where the desired behavior is achieved
                only asymptotically.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td valign="top" width="20"></td>
              <td valign="top"><em>L2</em></td>
              <td valign="top">To seek <b>approximate</b> inverses.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>In summary, we may conclude</p>

                inverse.</td>
