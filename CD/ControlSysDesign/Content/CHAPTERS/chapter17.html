        <h2 align="center">17. Linear State Space Models</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>We have seen that there are many alternative model formats that can
        be used for linear dynamic systems. In simple SISO problems, any
        representation is probably as good as any other. However, as we move to
        more complex problems (especially multivariable problems) it is
        desirable to use special model formats. One of the most flexible and
        useful structures is the state space model. As we saw in Chapter 3, this
        model takes the form of a coupled set of<b> first order</b> differential
        (or difference) equations. This model format is particularly useful with
        regard to numerical computations.</p>

        <p>State space models were briefly introduced in Chapter 3. Here we will
        examine linear state space models in a little more depth for the SISO
        case. Note, however, that many of the ideas will directly carry over to
        the multivariable case presented later. In particular, we will study</p>
        <ul>
          <li>similarity transformations and equivalent state representations</li>
          <li>state space model properties
            <ul>
              <li>controllability, reachability and stabililizability</li>
              <li>observability, reconstructability and detectability</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>special (canonical) model formats</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The key tools used in studying linear state space methods are linear
        algebra and vector space methods. The reader is thus encouraged to
        briefly review these concepts as a prelude to reading this chapter.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>State variables are system internal variables, upon which a full
            model for the system behavior can be built. The state variables can
            be ordered in a state vector.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Given a linear system, the choice of state variables is not
            unique. However,
            <ul>
              <li>the minimal dimension of the state vector is a system
                invariant,</li>
              <li>there exists a nonsingular matrix which defines a similarity
                transformation between any two state vectors, and</li>
              <li>any designed system output can be expressed as a linear
                combination of the states variables and the inputs.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For linear, time invariant systems the state space model is
            expressed in the following equations:<br>

          <li>Stability and natural response characteristics of the system can
            be studied from the eigenvalues of the matrix 
            <!-- MATH: $\ensuremath{\mathbf{A}}$ -->
            <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part5-img9.gif" alt="$\ensuremath{\mathbf{A}} $" width="17" height="14">

          <li>State space models facilitate the study of certain system
            properties which are paramount in the solution control design
            problem. These properties relate to the following questions
            <ul>
              <li>By proper choice of the input <i>u</i>, can we steer the
                system state to a desired state (point value)? controllability</li>
              <li>If some states are or uncontrollable, will these states
                generate a time decaying component? (stabilizability)</li>
              <li>If one knows the input, <i>u</i>(<i>t</i>) for <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part5-img12.gif" alt="$t\geq t_0$" width="43" height="28">,
                can we infer the state at time <i>t</i>=<i>t</i><sub>0</sub> by
                measuring the system output, <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) for <img align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="part5-img12.gif" alt="$t\geq t_0$" width="43" height="28">?
                (observability)</li>
              <li>If some of the states are unobservable, do these states
                generate a time decaying signal? (detectability)<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Controllability tells us about the feasibility to control a plant.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Observability tells us about whether it is possible to know what
            is happening in a given system by observing its outputs.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The above system properties are system invariants. However,
            changes in the number of inputs, in their injection points, in the
            number of measurements and in the choice of variables to be measured
            may yield different properties.</li>
          <li>A transfer function can always be derived from a state space
            model.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>A state space model can be built from a transfer function model.
            However, only the completely controllable and observable part of the
            system is described in that state space model. Thus <b>the transfer
            function model might be only a partial description of the system.<br>
            &nbsp;</b></li>
          <li>The properties of individual systems do not necessarily translate
            unmodified to composed systems. In particular, given two systems
            completely reachable, observable, controllable and reconstructible,
            their cascade connection:
            <ul>
              <li>is not completely observable if a pole of the first system
                coincides with a zero of the second system (pole-zero
                cancellation),</li>
              <li>is not detectable if the pole-zero cancellation affects an
                unstable pole,</li>
              <li>is not completely controllable if a zero of the first system
                coincides with a pole of the second system (zero-pole
                cancellation), and</li>
              <li>is not stabilizable if the zero-pole cancellation affects a
                NMP zero<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>this chapter provides a foundation for the design criteria which
            states that one should never attempt to cancel unstable poles and
            zeros.</li>
