        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <h3 align="left">1.3 Historical Periods of Control Theory</h3>

        <p>We have seen above that control engineering has taken several major
        steps forward at crucial times in history (e.g. the industrial
        revolution, the Second World War, the push into space, economic
        globalization, shareholder value thinking etc.). Each of these steps has
        been matched by a corresponding burst of development in the underlying
        theory of control.</p>

        <p>Early on, when the compelling concept of feedback was applied,
        engineers sometimes encountered unexpected results. These then became
        catalysts for rigorous analysis. For example, if we go back to Watt's
        fly ball governor, it was found that under certain circumstances these
        systems could produce self sustaining oscillations. Towards the end of
        the 19th century several researchers (including Maxwell) showed how
        these oscillations could be described via the properties of ordinary
        differential equations.</p>

        <p>The developments around the period of the Second World War were also
        matched by significant developments in Control Theory. For example, the
        pioneering work of Bode, Nyquist, Nichols, Evans and others appeared at
        this time. This resulted in simple graphical means for analyzing
        single-input single-output feedback control problems. These methods are
        now generally known by the generic term &quot;Classical Control
        Theory&quot;.</p>

        <p>The 1960's saw the development of an alternative state space approach
        to control. This followed the publication of work by Wiener, Kalman (and
        others) on optimal estimation and control. This work allowed
        multivariable problems to be treated in a unified fashion. This had been
        difficult, if not impossible, in the classical framework. This set of
        developments is loosely termed &quot;Modern Control Theory&quot;.</p>

        <p>By the 1980's these various approaches to control had reached a
        sophisticated level and emphasis then shifted to other related issues
        including the effect of model error on the performance of feedback
        controllers. This can be classified as the period of &quot;Robust
        Control Theory&quot;.</p>

        <p>In parallel there has been substantial work on nonlinear control
        problems. This has been motivated by the fact that many real world
        control problems involve nonlinear effects.</p>

        <p>There have been numerous other developments including adaptive
        control, autotuning, intelligent control etc. These are too numerous to
        detail here. Anyway, our purpose is not to give a comprehensive history
        but simply to give a flavor for the evolution of the field.</p>

        <p>At the time of writing this book, control has become a mature
        discipline. It is thus possible to give a treatment of control which
        takes account of many different viewpoints and to unify these in a
        common framework. This is the approach we will adopt here.</p>
