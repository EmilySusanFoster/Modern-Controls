        <p>An idealized requirement in MIMO control system design is that of
        decoupling. As discussed in section §20.4, decoupling can take various
        forms ranging from static (where decoupling is only demanded for
        constant reference signals) up to full dynamic decoupling (where
        decoupling is demanded at all frequencies). Clearly full dynamic
        decoupling is a stringent demand. Thus, in practice, it is more usual to
        seek dynamic decoupling over some desired bandwidth. If a plant is
        dynamically decoupled, then changes in the set-point of one process
        variable leads to a response in that process variable but <i>all other</i>
        process variables remain constant. The advantages of such a design are
        intuitively clear; i.e. a temperature may be required to be changed but
        it may be undesirable for other variables (e.g. pressure) to suffer any
        associated transient.</p>

        <p>This chapter describes the design procedures necessary to achieve
        dynamic decoupling. In particular, we discuss</p>
        <ul>
          <li>dynamic decoupling for stable minimum phase systems</li>
          <li>dynamic decoupling for stable non-minimum phase systems</li>
          <li>dynamic decoupling for open loop unstable systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As might be expected, full dynamic decoupling is a strong requirement
        and is generally not <em>cost free</em>. We will thus also quantify the
        costs of decoupling using frequency domain procedures. These allow a
        designer to assess <i>a priori</i> whether the cost associated with
        decoupling is acceptable in a given application.</p>

        <p>Of course, some form of decoupling is a very common requirement. For
        example, static decoupling is almost always called for. The question
        then becomes, over what bandwidth will decoupling (approximately) hold.
        All forms of decoupling come at a cost, and this can be evaluated using
        the techniques presented here. It will turn out that the additional cost
        of decoupling is a function of open loop poles and zeros in the right
        half plane. Thus, if one is interested in restricting decoupling to some
        bandwidth then by restricting attention to those open loop poles and
        zeros that fall within this bandwidth one can get a feel for the cost of
        decoupling over that bandwidth. In this sense, the results presented in
        this chapter are applicable to almost all MIMO design problems since
        some form of decoupling over a limited bandwidth (usually around dc) is
        almost always required.</p>

        <p>We will also examine the impact of actuator saturation on decoupling.
        In the case of static decoupling, it is necessary to avoid integrator
        wind-up. This can be achieved using methods that are analogous to the
        SISO case treated in Chapter11. In the case of full dynamic decoupling,
        special precautions are necessary to maintain decoupling in the face of
        actuator limits. We show that this is indeed possible by appropriate use
        of MIMO anti wind-up mechanisms.</p>

          <li>Recall (Chapter 20) that there are different degrees of decoupling,

          <li>The severity and type of trade-offs associated with decoupling
            depend on
            <ul>
              <li>whether the system is minimum phase</li>
              <li>the directionality and cardinality of non-minimum phase zeros</li>
              <li>unstable poles.<br>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If all of a systems unstable zeros are canonical (their
            directionality affects one output only), then their adverse effect
            is not spread to other channels by decoupling provided that the
            direction of decoupling is congruent with the direction of the
            unstable zeros.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The price for dynamically decoupling a system with non-canonical
            non-minimum phase zeros of simple multiplicity is that
            <ul>
              <li>the effect of the non-minimum phase zeros is potentially
                spread across several loops</li>
              <li>therefore, although the loops are decoupled, each of the
                affected loops needs to observe the bandwidth and sensitivity
                limitations imposed by the unstable zero dynamics.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          <li>If one accepts the less stringent triangular decoupling, the
            effect of dispersing limitations due to non-minimum phase zeros can
            be minimized.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Depending on the case, a higher cardinality of non-minimum phase
            zeros can either enforce or mitigate the adverse effects.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>If a system is also open-loop unstable, there may not be any way
            at all for achieving full dynamic decoupling by a one d.o.f.

            architecture for reference signal changes.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>If a system is essentially linear but exhibits actuator
            nonlinearities such as input or slew rate saturations, then the
            controller design must reflect this appropriately.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Otherwise, the MIMO generalization of the SISO wind-up phenomenon
            may occur.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>MIMO wind-up manifests itself in two aspects of performance
            degradation:
            <ul>
              <li>transients due to growing controller states</li>
              <li>transients due to the nonlinearity impacting on directionality<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The first of these two phenomenon <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part8-img27.gif" alt="$\ldots$" width="25" height="13">
            <ul>
              <li>is in analogy to the SISO case</li>
              <li>is due to the saturated control signal not being able to
                annihilate the control errors sufficiently fast compared to the
                controller dynamics; therefore the control states continue to
                grow in response to the non-decreasing control. These <em>wound
                up</em> states produce the transients when the loop emerges from
                saturation.</li>
              <li>can be compensated by a direct generalization of the SISO anti
                wind-up implementation.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The second phenomenon <img align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="part8-img27.gif" alt="$\ldots$" width="25" height="13">
            <ul>
              <li>is specific to MIMO systems</li>
              <li>is due to uncompensated interactions arising from the input
                vector loosing its original design direction.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In analogy to the SISO case, there can be regions in state space,
            from which an open loop unstable MIMO system with input saturation
            cannot be stabilized by any control.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>More severely than in the SISO case, MIMO systems are difficult to
            control in the presence of input saturation, even if the linear loop
            is stable and the controller is implemented with anti wind-up. This
            is due to saturation changing the directionality of the input
            vector.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>This problem of preserving decoupling in the presence of input
            saturation can be addressed by anti wind-up schemes that scale the
            control error rather than the control signal.</li>
