        <h3>1.5.9 Disturbances and uncertainty</h3>

        <p>One of the things that makes control science interesting is that all
        real life systems are acted on by noise and external disturbances. These
        factors can have a significant impact on the performance of the system.
        As a simple example, aircraft are subject to disturbances in the form of
        wind-gusts, and cruise controllers in cars have to cope with different
        road gradients and different car loadings. However, we will find that,
        by appropriate design of the control system, quite remarkable
        insensitivity to external disturbances can be achieved.</p>

        <p>Another related issue is that of model uncertainty. All real world
        systems have very complex models but an important property of feedback
        control is that one can often achieve the desired level of performance
        by using relatively simple models. Of course, it is beholden on
        designers to appreciate the effect of model uncertainty on control
        performance and to decide if attention to better modeling would enable
        better performance to be achieved.</p>

        <p>Both of the issues raised above are addressed, in part, by the
        remarkable properties of feedback. This concept will underpin much of
        our development in the book.</p>
