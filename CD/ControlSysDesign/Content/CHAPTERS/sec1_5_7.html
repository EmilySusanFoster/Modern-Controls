        <h3>1.5.7 Architectures and interfacing</h3>

        <p>The issue of what to connect to what is a non-trivial one in control
        system design. One may feel that the best solution would always be to
        bring all signals to a central point so that each control action would
        be based on complete information (leading to so called, centralized
        control). However, this is rarely (if ever) the best solution in
        practice. Indeed, there are very good reasons why one may not wish to
        bring all signals to a common point. Obvious objections to this include
        complexity, cost, time constraints in computation, maintainability,
        reliability, etc.</p>

        <p>Thus one usually partitions the control problem into manageable
        sub-systems. How one does this is part of the control engineer's domain.
        Indeed, we will see in the case studies presented in the text that these
        architectural issues can be crucial to the final success, or otherwise,
        of a control system.</p>

        <p>Indeed, one of the principal tools that a control system designer can
        use to improve performance is to exercise lateral thinking relative to
        the architecture of the control problem. As an illustration, we will
        present a real example later in the text (see <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter
        9</a>) where thickness control performance in a reversing rolling mill
        was irrevocably constrained by a particular architecture. It is shown
        that no improvement in actuators, sensors or algorithms (within this
        architecture) can remedy the problem. However, by simply changing the
        architecture so as to include extra actuators (namely the currents into
        coiler and uncoiler motors) then the difficulty is resolved (see <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter
        12</a>). As a simpler illustration, the reader is invited to compare the
        difference between trying to balance a broom on one's finger with one's
        eyes open or shut. Again there is an architectural difference here -
        this time it is a function of available sensors. A full analysis of the
        reasons behind the observed differences in the difficulty of these types
        of control problems will be explained in <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter
        13</a> of the book.</p>

        <p>We thus see that architectural issues are of paramount importance in
        control design problems. A further architectural issue revolves around
        the need to &quot;divide and conquer&quot; complex problems. This leads
        to a hierarchical view of control as illustrated in <a href="#tab:typi_cont">Table
        1.1</a></p>

        <p>Having decided what connections need to be made, there is the issue
        of interfacing the various sub-components. This is frequently a
        non-trivial job as it is often true that special interfaces are needed
        between different equipment. Fortunately vendors of control equipment
        are aware of this difficulty and increasing attention is being paid to
        standardization of interfaces.</p>
