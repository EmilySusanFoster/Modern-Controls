        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <h3 align="left">2.7 From open to closed loop architectures</h3>

        <p>A particular scheme was suggested in <a href="sec2_6.html#fig:inv1">Figure
        2.8</a> for building an approximate inverse of the plant model. Although
        the controller in this scheme is implemented as a feedback system, the
        control is actually applied to the plant in <b>open loop</b>. In
        particular, we see that the control signal <i>u</i>(<i>t</i>) is <b>independent
        of what is actually happening in the plant</b>. This is a serious
        drawback, since the methodology will not lead to a satisfactory solution
        to the control problem unless:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the model on which the design of the controller has been based is
            a very good representation of the plant,<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>the model and its inverse are stable, and<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>disturbances and initial conditions are negligible.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We are thus motivated to find an alternative solution to the problem
        which retains the key features but which does not suffer from the above
        drawback. This is indeed possible by changing the scheme slightly so
        that feedback is placed around the <b>plant</b> itself rather than
        around the <b>model</b>.</p>

        <p>To develop this idea we begin with the basic feedback structure as
        illustrated in <a href="#fig:inv2">Figure 2.10</a>. We proceed as
        follows.</p>

        <strong>Figure 2.10:</strong> Open loop control with built-in inverse</p>

        <p>If we assume, for the moment, that the model in <a href="#fig:inv2">Figure
        2.10</a> is perfect, then we can rearrange the diagram to yield the
        alternative scheme shown in <a href="#fig:inv3">Figure 2.11</a></p>

        <p align="center"><a name="fig:inv3"><img src="fig2_11.gif" width="497" height="105"></a><br>
        <strong>Figure 2.11:</strong> Closed loop control</p>

        <p>This scheme, which has been derived from an open loop architecture,
        is the basis of feedback control. The key feature of this scheme is that
        the controller output depends not only on the a-priori data provided by
        the model, but also depends on what is actually happening at the plant
        output at every instant. It has other interesting features which are
        discussed in detail below. However at this point it will be worthwhile
        to carry out an initial discussion of the similarities and differences
        between open and closed loop architectures of the types shown in <a href="#fig:inv2">Figure
        2.10</a> and <a href="#fig:inv3">Figure 2.11</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first thing to note is that, provided the model represents the
            plant exactly, and that all signals are bounded (i.e. the loop is
            stable), then both schemes are equivalent, <b>regarding the relation
            between </b><b>r(<i>t</i>)</b><b><i> </i>and <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>)</b><i>.</i>
            The key differences are due to disturbances and different initial
            conditions.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>In the open loop control scheme the controller incorporates
            feedback internally, i.e. a signal at point A is fed back. In closed
            loop control the signal at A' is fed back. The fundamental
            difference is that, in the first case everything happens <b>inside
            the controller</b>, i.e. either in a computer or in some external
            hardware connection. In the second case, the signal which is fed
            back is a process variable, i.e. <b>measuring devices are used</b>
            to determine what is actually happening. The heuristic advantages of
            the latter alternative are undoubtedly clear to the reader. We will
            develop the formal background to these advantages as we proceed.</li>
