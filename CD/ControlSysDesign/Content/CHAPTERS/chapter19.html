        <h2 align="center">19. Introduction to Nonlinear Control</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <a name="Preview"><h3 align="left">Preview</h3></a>

        <p>With the exception of our treatment of actuator limits, all previous
        material in the book has been aimed at linear systems. This is justified
        by the fact that most real world systems exhibit (near) linear behaviour
        and by the significantly enhanced insights available in the linear case.
        However, one occasionally meets a problem where the nonlinearities are
        so important that they cannot be ignored. This chapter is intended to
        give a <em>brief</em> introduction to nonlinear control. Our objective
        is not to be comprehensive but to simply give some simple extensions of
        linear strategies that might allow a designer to <em>make a start</em>
        on a nonlinear problem. As far as possible, we will build on the linear
        methods so as to maximally benefit from linear insights. We also give a
        &quot;taste&quot; of more rigorous nonlinear theory so as to give the
        reader an appreciation for this fascinating and evolving subject.</p>
        <a name="Summary"><h3 align="left">Summary</h3></a>
        <ul>
          <li>So far, the entire book has dealt with linear system and
            controllers.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>This chapter generalizes the scope to include various types of
            nonlinearities:<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>A number of properties that are very helpful in linear control are
            not - or not directly-applicable to the nonlinear case.
            <ul>
              <li><i>Frequency analysis</i>: The response to a sinusoidal signal
                is not necessarily a sinusoid; therefore frequency analysis,
                Bode plots, etc, cannot be directly carried over from the linear
                case.</li>
              <li><i>Transfer functions</i>: The notion of transfer functions,
                poles, zeros and their respective cancellation is not directly
                applicable.</li>
              <li><i>Stability</i> becomes more involved.</li>
              <li><i>Inversion</i>: It was highlighted in Chapter 15, on affine
                structures, that whether or not the controller contains the
                inverse of the model as a factor and whether or not one inverts
                the model explicitly - control is fundamentally linked to the
                ability to invert. Numerous nonlinear functions encountered,
                however, are not invertible (such as saturations, for example).</li>
              <li><i>Superposition</i> does not apply; that is: the effects of
                two signals (such as setpoint and disturbance) acting on the
                system individually cannot simply be summed (superimposed) to
                determine the effect of the signals acting simultaneously on the
                system.</li>
              <li><i>Commutativity</i> does not apply.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>As a consequence, the mathematics for nonlinear control become
            more involved, solutions and results are not as complete and
            intuition can fail more easily than in the linear case.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Nevertheless, nonlinearities are frequently encountered and are a
            very important consideration.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Smooth static nonlinearities at input and output
            <ul compact>
              <li>are frequently a consequence of nonlinear actuator and sensor
                characteristics</li>
              <li>are the easiest form of nonlinearities to compensate</li>
              <li>can be compensated by applying the inverse function to the
                relevant signal, thus obtaining a linear system in the
                pre-compensated signals (caution, however with singular points
                such as division by zero, etc, for particular signal values).<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Non-smooth nonlinearities cannot in general be exactly compensated
            or linearized.<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>The chapter applies a nonlinear generalization of the affine
            parameterization of Chapter 15 to construct a controller that
            generates a feedback linearizing controller if the model is smoothly
            nonlinear with stable inverse<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>Nonlinear stability can be investigated using a variety of
            techniques. Two common strategies are
            <ul>
              <li>Lyapunov methods</li>
              <li>Function Space methods<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Extensions of linear robustness analysis to the nonlinear case are
            possible<br>
            &nbsp;</li>
          <li>There also exist nonlinear sensitivity limitations which mirror
            those for the linear case</li>
        </ul>
