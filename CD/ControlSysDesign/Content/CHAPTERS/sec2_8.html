        <h2 align="center">Introduction to the Principles of Feedback Control</h2>
        <!------------------------------------------------>

        <h3 align="left">2.8 Trade-offs involved in choosing the feedback gain</h3>

        <p>The preliminary insights of the previous two sections could seem to
        imply that all that is needed to generate a controller is to put high
        gain feedback around the plant. This is true in so far that it goes.
        However, nothing in life is cost free and this also applies to the use
        of high gain feedback.</p>

        <p>For example, if a plant disturbance leads to a non-zero error <i>e</i>(<i>t</i>),
        in <a href="sec2_7.html#fig:inv3">Figure 2.11</a>, then high gain
        feedback will result in a very large control action <i>u</i>(<i>t</i>).
        This may lie outside the available input range and thus invalidate the
        solution.</p>

        <p>Another potential problem with high gain feedback is that it is often
        accompanied by the very substantial risk of instability.<a name="311">&nbsp;</a>
        Instability is characterized by self sustaining (or growing)
        oscillations. As an illustration, the reader will probably have
        witnessed the high pitch whistling sound that is heard when a
        loudspeaker is placed too close to a microphone. This is a manifestation
        of instability resulting from excessive feedback gain. Tragic
        manifestations of instability include aircraft crashes and the Chernobyl
        disaster in which a runaway condition occurred.</p>

        <p>Yet another potential disadvantage of high loop gain was hinted at in
        <a href="sec2_3_4.html">subsection 2.3.4</a>. There we saw that
        increasing the controller gain leads to increased sensitivity to
        measurement noise.</p>

        <p>In summary, high loop gain is desirable from many perspectives but it
        is also undesirable when viewed from other perspectives. Thus, when
        choosing the feedback gain one needs to make a conscious trade-off
        between competing issues.</p>

        <p>The previous discussion can be summarized in the following statement</p>
        <div align="center">
          <center>
          <table border="1" width="90%" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
              <td>High loop gain gives approximate inversion which is the
                essence of control. However, in practice, the choice of feedback
                gain is part of a complex web of design trade-offs.
                Understanding and balancing these trade-offs is the essence of
                control system design.</td>
