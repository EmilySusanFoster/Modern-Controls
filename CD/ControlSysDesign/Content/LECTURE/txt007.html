<p>Similar results also hold for nonlinear systems - although the theory is much
more complicated and less well developed than in the linear case. In particular,
there are nonlinear versions of <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> as shown on the slide.
However, the nonlinear case is much harder, i.e. the principle of superposition
no longer applies.</p>
