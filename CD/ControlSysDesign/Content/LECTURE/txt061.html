The above story is actually typical of all real world control system problems.
One needs<b>: better sensors</b> (to <i>see</i> the state of the system); <b>better
actuators</b> (to change the state of the system) and <b>better control
algorithms</b> (to provide the required finesse when connecting sensors to
actuators). The last aspect is crucial. Indeed, we are certain that the reader
will know many people who have good eyes (sensors) and strong muscles
(actuators) but who cannot play tennis at the highest international level
because they lack the required hand-eye coordination (i.e. they do not have
sufficiently sophisticated control algorithms).
