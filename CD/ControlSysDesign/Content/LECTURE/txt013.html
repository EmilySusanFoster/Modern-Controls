A key problem is that of actuator ranging. To be able to go from a pH of 11 to 7
requires a large control valve. However, this corresponds to a 10,000:1 change
in concentration due to the nonlinear characteristic of the pH sensor. Thus a 1%
error in the valve would result in a 100:1 change in final concentration. That
is, if one were aiming for a final pH of 7, then it could vary from 5 to 7 due
to these valve imperfections!
