<p align="center"><b>Explanation for slide 38</b></p>
This picture shows a schematic of the centre line thickness control problem (in
its simplest form). Note that there is delay between the thickness at the
roll-gap and the thickness as measured by the sensor. Recall from slide 6 of
this talk that the presence of a delay fundamentally inhibits ones ability to
reduce sensitivity; i.e. to achieve good control. If unaddressed, this
limitation would completely eradicate any benefits achievable from the provision
of modern accurate sensors or modern high speed actuators.
