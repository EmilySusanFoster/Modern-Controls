Well, we are actually now led back to the topic of fundamental limitations.
Indeed, we can use elementary Laplace Transform theory to learn some remarkable
facts. If one evaluates the Laplace Transform of the error response then it is
as given on the top of this slide, where <i>T</i> is the (complementary)
sensitivity function described on slide 5. However, since the plant has zeros on
the imaginary axis, then so does <i>T</i>. Hence, evaluating the Laplace
Transform expression at the frequencies on the imaginary axis gives the results
at the bottom of the slide. Again, the reader must be wondering, so what … ?
