In summary, we have discussed a number of real world design problems ranging
from pH control, to continuous casting of metal, to rolling mills and finally
food processing. We have seen that, as one delves more deeply into these
problems, so one is inevitably forced to consider nonlinear issues (including
nonlinear dynamics and constraints on actuators and states). Moreover, to carry
out a design in the face of these nonlinearities, requires an appreciation of
fundamental limitations.
