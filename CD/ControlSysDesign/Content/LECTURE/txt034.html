There are many other interesting issues. For example, we have called the control
signals in the above discussion <i>cooling water</i> but, in fact, the
temperature of the rolls changes with time as shown in the figure. Hence, the
water starts out as <i>heating water</i>. (Increasing the flow of water then
actually expands the rolls). Eventually, the temperature of the rolls passes the
temperature of the water, at which time, the sign of the gain of the controller
has to be changed. This is a highly nonlinear phenomenon that cannot be
addressed by traditional robust control.
