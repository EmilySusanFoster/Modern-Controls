The problem referred to above is absolutely fundamental and thus cannot be
remedied <i>- within the given architecture</i>. However, this implies we should
look for alternative architectures. One solution is to replace the (delayed)
measurement of exit thickness by a virtual sensor (or observer) driven by other
quantities that can be measured without delay. One such idea is called a <b>Mass
Flow Estimator.</b> The key idea here is that conservation of mass across the
roll gap means that the product of strip velocity and thickness is preserved. (
Note that the width is very nearly constant.)
