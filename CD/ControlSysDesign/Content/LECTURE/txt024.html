Unfortunately, there is not much one can do here. One possibility is to dither
the valve with a small high frequency signal. This overcomes the stiction
effects but clearly tends to wear the valve. ( Another fundamental design
trade-off.) Nonetheless, the benefits of having improved quality in the final
product greatly outweigh the cost of having to replace the valve more
frequently.
