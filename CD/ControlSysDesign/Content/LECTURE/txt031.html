The first sub-problem we look at is flatness control. This is a
transverse-machine problem. The slide shows a model of the roll. The essential
issue of interest here is that non-uniform roll radii can produce non-uniform
flatness in the rolled product. Several control loops are typically used to
address this problem. For example, water sprays are used to <i>cool</i> the
rolls - hence differentially changing their radii across the machine.
