One answer to the above problem is to reduce the pH in stages. Indeed, because
of the logarithmic nature of the pH curve, then the stages should have set
points that are evenly spaced in a logarithmic sense as shown on the slide. It
is also shown on the slide that this multistage arrangement allows accurate pH
regulation to be achieved even with 5% valve imperfections.
