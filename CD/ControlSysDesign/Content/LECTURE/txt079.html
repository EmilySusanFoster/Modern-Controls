We thus see that, in a non-trivial region of state space, mpc and anti-windup
are identical. This result has many interesting implications. It allows insights
to be cross fertilised from the two fields, it opens the door to the possibility
(in some cases) of simple <i>closed form</i> solutions to mpc problems without
having to solve an on-line optimization problem; and it suggests new proofs of
stability.
