<p>This plot was obtained by evaluating the closed form expression for the value
function in the optimal control problem. The horizontal axis is the value of the
constraint <i>a</i> in | <i>u</i> | <font face="Symbol">£</font><i> a</i>. The
vertical axis is the (logarithmic of the) quadratic cost function. We see that
for <i>a </i>large, the cost function reaches an asymptote. Actually, this
asymptote has been very well studied in the literature on linear optimal control
under the heading of <b>Cheap Control</b>. As we move left along the plot, so
the constraint becomes harder (i.e. <i>a</i> decreases). Near the value <i>a</i>
= 1, we see that there is a sharp increase in cost. Thus, we see that, at this
point, the constraint on the actuator becomes a significant factor in the
achievable performance. These kinds of considerations may allow us (in the
future) to address such fundamental design issues as actuator sizing.</p>
