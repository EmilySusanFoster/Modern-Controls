Indeed, the coiler and uncoiler currents are exactly what we are looking for.
This is because the physical source of the imaginary axis zeros in this problem
is actually strip <i>tension interactions</i> and the coiler and uncoiler
currents allow us to effect these tensions. This leads to a very interesting 3
input-1 output control problem as shown on this slide. The system is subject to
many fundamental limitations (the range of the currents is limited and there
still exists the zeros between roll-gap (<i>s</i>) and thickness (<i>h</i>).
However, by clever nonlinear MIMO design one can <i>steer</i> <i>around</i> the
various limitations in this architecture due to the extra flexibility provided
by the extra current inputs; and finally …
