One solution to this problem is to use an adaptive controller which uses an
on-line estimator for the system gain. This plot shows the relationship between
true and estimated gain using such a scheme. However, this solution raises even
more interesting fundamental design trade-offs. For example, it is necessary to
apply external perturbations so as to be able to estimate the gain but these
perturbations detract from the quality of the regulatory control. Thus there is
a clear performance trade-off and balance needed in the design.
