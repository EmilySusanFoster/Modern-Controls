Another issue is, how big should we make the mixing tanks in which the pH
neutralisation occurs. The bigger the tank, the greater the smoothing of
fluctuations. Of course, one needs to make sure that the errors produced by
incoming pH fluctuations are commensurate with those originating from valve
imperfections. This matching of bandwidth with quantisation granuality is
similar to sub-band coding in the area of communications.
