In the spirit of obtaining a virtual sensor for strip velocity, we examine the
physical arrangement of the coiler and uncoiler (where the strip is stored on
each side of the mill). As indicated in the figure, if you could measure the
radius of the material on the rolls and also the angular velocity of the rolls,
then their product would immediately give the required strip velocity. Actually,
measuring angular velocity is easy (a simple pulse encoder will do) but
measuring the radius is harder …
