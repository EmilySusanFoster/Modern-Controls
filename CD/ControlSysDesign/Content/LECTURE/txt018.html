<p align="center"><b>Explanation for slide 18</b></p>
This slide shows simulation results which confirm the performance of the above
design. The top left plot shows the effect on pH of a varying influent flow rate
into a single tank. The bottom left plot shows the effect on pH of a sticking
valve in a single tank. (Actually a very small variation in influent flow has
been applied to the system so that the effect of the sticking valve can be
seen.) Note that the size of the errors in these two plots are comparable. The
plot on the right hand side shows the result when 3 stages of pH neutralisation
are used. Notice that the final pH (<b><font color="#0000ff">blue</font></b>
curve) is very close to 7 despite the difficulties discussed above.
