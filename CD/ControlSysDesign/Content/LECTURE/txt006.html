<p align="center"><b>Explanation for slide 6</b></p>

<p>Results on fundamental limitations for linear feedback systems have a long
history - beginning with Bode's own work. A flavour of some of the results is
given here. </p>

<p>In particular, the first result shows that <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> cannot be
simultaneously made small. </p>

<p>The third result says that our ability to reduce <i>T</i> below <i>1</i>
(where log <i>T </i>becomes zero) is made more difficult by the presence of
right half plane zeros (<i>q<sub>i</sub></i> on the slide) and pure delays in
the plant ( <font face="Symbol">t</font> on the slide). </p>

<p>The second last result shows that the maximum value of <i>S</i> (as a
function of frequency) cannot be less than one if the system has a right half
pane zero. </p>

<p>The last result shows that the maximum value of <i>T</i> cannot be less than
one if the system is open loop unstable.</p>
