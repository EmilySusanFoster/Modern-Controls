The above slide gave the essential idea of the mass-flow virtual sensor for exit
thickness. However, there are many associated practical issues. For example, it
is non-trivial to measure strip velocity in the hostile environment in which
these systems operate. This raises further practical fundamental design issues.
It thus seems that, no sooner do we solve one problem, then yet another emerges.
However, this is part of the excitement of control engineering.
