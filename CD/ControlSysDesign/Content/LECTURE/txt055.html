Well, if you manipulate the previous expression a little, then you get the
fundamental constraint shown on this slide. In fact this says that the <i>hold-up</i>
effect is entirely due to those pesky imaginary axis zeros. Moreover, (and this
is the key issue), because the limitation is fundamental, no control system
(within the given architectures) can overcome the problem. We thus see how
important fundamental limitations are. Without the insight they provide, one
could spend hours (maybe years) trying to design a controller (fuzzy, adaptive,
nonlinear, … ) to overcome the problem. However, we know, a priori, that all
must fail !
