However, at least in the system that we are familiar with, the oscillation
problem was directly attributed to valve imperfections. Thus, we see that this
problem has fundamental limitations which are actually very similar to those
experienced in the case of pH! Here, however, there is an extra complexity;
namely it is not possible to use multiple valves (dual range control) since the
molten steel would clearly solidify in any small valve. Thus, we have an even
more difficult fundamental performance limitation in this case.
