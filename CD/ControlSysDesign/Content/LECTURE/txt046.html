Actually this is rather tricky. In order to use mass balance across the
roll-gap, we first have to align the measured input and output thickness with
the roll-gap. However, this alignment can only be done if we first know the
strip velocity. The catch is that this whole exercise was aimed at estimating
strip velocity in the first place! The solution is to use an iterative algorithm
in which one successively estimates parameters in the radius model, then uses
this model to estimate the strip velocity, then makes the necessary alignment of
input and output thickness measurements, then re-estimate the parameters in the
radius model and so on. A highly nonlinear scheme !
