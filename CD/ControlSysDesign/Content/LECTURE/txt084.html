Thus, in conclusion, we see that real world problems often need nonlinear
thinking for their solution. We also see that real world problems are subject to
a host of fundamental limitations. In this context, the job of the designer is
to ease a feasible solution into the associated complex web of trade-offs and
constraints. This is interesting and exciting work. Much is known - but even
more remains to be discovered. The opportunities are endless !
